> StorSimple 8000 series will reach its end-of-life in December 2022. Microsoft provides a [dedicated migration service](../articles/storage/files/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000.md) for StorSimple 8000 series volumes and their backups. It is imperative that you stop any new StorSimple deployments and begin planning your migration now.

The StorSimple Data Manager contains a dedicated migration service for your StorSimple volumes and their backups. If you want to preserve your file and folder structure, ACLs, timestamps, attributes, and backups, then Azure Files is the ideal choice.
[Review the migration guide](../articles/storage/files/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000.md).
