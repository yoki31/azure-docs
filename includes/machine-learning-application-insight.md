> [!TIP]
> An Azure Application Insights instance is created when you create the workspace. You can delete the Application Insights instance after cluster creation if you want. Deleting it limits the information gathered from the workspace, and may make it more difficult to troubleshoot problems. __If you delete the Application Insights instance created by the workspace, you cannot re-create it without deleting and recreating the workspace__.
>
> For more information on using this Application Insights instance, see [Monitor and collect data from Machine Learning web service endpoints](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-enable-app-insights.md).
