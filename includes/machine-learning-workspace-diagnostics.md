You can run diagnostics on your workspace from Azure Machine Learning studio or the Python SDK. After diagnostics run, a list of any detected problems is returned. This list includes links to possible solutions. For more information, see [How to use workspace diagnostics](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-workspace-diagnostic-api.md).
