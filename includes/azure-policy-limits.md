For assignments and exemptions, an entry of _Scope_ means the [management group](../articles/governance/management-groups/overview.md), subscription, resource group, or individual resource.

| Where | What | Maximum count |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Policy definitions | 500 |
| Scope | Initiative definitions | 200 |
| Tenant | Initiative definitions | 2,500 |
| Scope | Policy or initiative assignments | 200 |
| Scope | Exemptions | 1000 |
| Policy definition | Parameters | 20 |
