The next step is to download the Azure Spatial Anchors packages for Unity. 

To use Azure Spatial Anchors in Unity, you need to download **both** the **core package** (`com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.core`) and a **platform-specific package** for each platform that you plan to support.

| Platform | Package name                                    |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| All Platforms  | `com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.core@<version_number>` |
| Android  | `com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.android@<version_number>` |
| iOS      | `com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.ios@<version_number>`     |
| HoloLens | `com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.windows@<version_number>` |

## [Download with web browser](#tab/unity-package-web-ui)

Locate the Azure Spatial Anchors core package (`com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.core`) for Unity [here](https://dev.azure.com/aipmr/MixedReality-Unity-Packages/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=Unity-packages). Select the version you want and download the package using the **Download** button. **Repeat** this step to download the package for each platform that you plan to support.

## [Download with NPM](#tab/unity-package-npm)

The following steps assume that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">NPM</a> is installed and available.

Run the following command replacing `<version_number>` with the version of Azure Spatial Anchors you want to download
to the current folder:

```bash
npm pack com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.core@<version_number> --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/aipmr/MixedReality-Unity-Packages/_packaging/Unity-packages/npm/registry/
```

> [!NOTE]
> To list the available versions of the Azure Spatial Anchors package, run the following:
>
> ```bash
> npm view com.microsoft.azure.spatial-anchors-sdk.core --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/aipmr/MixedReality-Unity-Packages/_packaging/Unity-packages/npm/registry/ versions
> ```

The Azure Spatial Anchors core package will be downloaded to the folder where you ran the command. **Repeat** this step to download the package for each platform that you plan to support.

## [Install with Mixed Reality Feature Tool](#tab/unity-package-mixed-reality-feature-tool)

Continue to the next step. You'll use the <a href="/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Feature Tool</a> in a later step.
