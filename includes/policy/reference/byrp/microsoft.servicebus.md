|---|---|---|---|
|[All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Service Bus namespace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa1817ec0-a368-432a-8057-8371e17ac6ee) |Service Bus clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_AuditNamespaceAccessRules_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Service Bus namespaces should have local authentication methods disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcfb11c26-f069-4c14-8e36-56c394dae5af) |Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Azure Service Bus namespaces exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/disablelocalauth-sb](../../../../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_DisableLocalAuth_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Azure Service Bus namespaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1c06e275-d63d-4540-b761-71f364c2111d) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Service Bus namespaces, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/private-link-service](../../../../articles/service-bus-messaging/private-link-service.md). |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Configure Azure Service Bus namespaces to disable local authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F910711a6-8aa2-4f15-ae62-1e5b2ed3ef9e) |Disable local authentication methods so that your Azure ServiceBus namespaces exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/disablelocalauth-sb](../../../../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas.md). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_DisableLocalAuth_Modify.json) |

|[Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Service Bus to Event Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6b51af03-9277-49a9-a3f8-1c69c9ff7403) |Deploys the diagnostic settings for Service Bus to stream to a regional Event Hub when any Service Bus which is missing this diagnostic settings is created or updated. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/ServiceBus_DeployDiagnosticLog_Deploy_EventHub.json) |
|[Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Service Bus to Log Analytics workspace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F04d53d87-841c-4f23-8a5b-21564380b55e) |Deploys the diagnostic settings for Service Bus to stream to a regional Log Analytics workspace when any Service Bus which is missing this diagnostic settings is created or updated. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/ServiceBus_DeployDiagnosticLog_Deploy_LogAnalytics.json) |
|[Resource logs in Service Bus should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff8d36e2f-389b-4ee4-898d-21aeb69a0f45) |Audit enabling of resource logs. This enables you to recreate activity trails to use for investigation purposes; when a security incident occurs or when your network is compromised |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[5.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_AuditDiagnosticLog_Audit.json) |
|[Service Bus namespaces should have double encryption enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Febaf4f25-a4e8-415f-86a8-42d9155bef0b) |Enabling double encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. When double encryption has been enabled, data in the storage account is encrypted twice, once at the service level and once at the infrastructure level, using two different encryption algorithms and two different keys. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_InfrastructureEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Service Bus Premium namespaces should use a customer-managed key for encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F295fc8b1-dc9f-4f53-9c61-3f313ceab40a) |Azure Service Bus supports the option of encrypting data at rest with either Microsoft-managed keys (default) or customer-managed keys. Choosing to encrypt data using customer-managed keys enables you to assign, rotate, disable, and revoke access to the keys that Service Bus will use to encrypt data in your namespace. Note that Service Bus only supports encryption with customer-managed keys for premium namespaces. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_CustomerManagedKeyEnabled_Audit.json) |
