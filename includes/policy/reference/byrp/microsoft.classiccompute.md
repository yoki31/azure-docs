|[A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F501541f7-f7e7-4cd6-868c-4190fdad3ac9) |Audits virtual machines to detect whether they are running a supported vulnerability assessment solution. A core component of every cyber risk and security program is the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities. Azure Security Center's standard pricing tier includes vulnerability scanning for your virtual machines at no extra cost. Additionally, Security Center can automatically deploy this tool for you. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_ServerVulnerabilityAssessment_Audit.json) |
|[Adaptive application controls for defining safe applications should be enabled on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F47a6b606-51aa-4496-8bb7-64b11cf66adc) |Enable application controls to define the list of known-safe applications running on your machines, and alert you when other applications run. This helps harden your machines against malware. To simplify the process of configuring and maintaining your rules, Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on each machine and suggest the list of known-safe applications. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AdaptiveApplicationControls_Audit.json) |
|[All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security Center has identified some of your network security groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |

Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the running processes on your machines and suggest a list of known-safe applications. These are presented as recommended apps to allow in adaptive application control policies. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AdaptiveApplicationControlsUpdate_Audit.json) |

IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_IPForwardingOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
