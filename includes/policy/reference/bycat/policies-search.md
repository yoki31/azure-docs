|[Azure Cognitive Search service should use a SKU that supports private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa049bf77-880b-470f-ba6d-9f21c530cf83) |With supported SKUs of Azure Cognitive Search, Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your Search service, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/inbound-private-endpoints](../../../../articles/search/service-create-private-endpoint.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/Search_RequirePrivateLinkSupportedResource_Deny.json) |

Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of your Search service.

Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/rbac](../../../../articles/search/search-security-rbac.md). Note that while the disable local authentication parameter is still in preview, the deny effect for this policy may result in limited Azure Cognitive Search portal functionality since some features of the Portal use the GA API which does not support the parameter. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/Search_DisableLocalAuth_AuditDeny.json) |
