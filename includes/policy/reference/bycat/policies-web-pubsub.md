|[Azure Web PubSub Service should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbf45113f-264e-4a87-88f9-29ac8a0aca6a) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that Azure Web PubSub service isn't exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of Azure Web PubSub service.

|[Azure Web PubSub Service should use a SKU that supports private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F82909236-25f3-46a6-841c-fe1020f95ae1) |With supported SKU, Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Web PubSub service, you can reduce data leakage risks.
