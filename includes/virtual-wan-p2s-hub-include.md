1. On the page for your **virtual WAN**, on the left pane, select **Hubs**. On the **Hubs** page, select **+New Hub**.

1. On the **Create virtual hub** page, view the **Basics** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/virtual-wan-p2s-hub/create-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create virtual hub.":::

1. On the **Basics** tab, configure the following settings:

   * **Region**: Select the region in which you want to deploy the virtual hub.
   * **Name**: The name by which you want the virtual hub to be known.
   * **Hub private address space**: The hub's address range in CIDR notation.

1. Click the **Point to site** tab to open the configuration page for point-to-site. To view the point to site settings, click **Yes**.

1. Configure the following settings:

   * **Gateway scale units** - This represents the aggregate capacity of the User VPN gateway. If you select 40 or more gateway scale units, plan your client address pool accordingly. For information about how this setting impacts the client address pool, see [About client address pools](../articles/virtual-wan/about-client-address-pools.md). For information about gateway scale units, see the [FAQ](../articles/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-faq.md#for-user-vpn-point-to-site--how-many-clients-are-supported).
   * **Point to site configuration** - Select the User VPN configuration that you created in a previous step.
   * **Routing preference** - Azure routing preference enables you to choose how your traffic routes between Azure and the Internet. You can choose to route traffic either via the Microsoft network, or, via the ISP network (public internet). These options are also referred to as cold potato routing and hot potato routing, respectively. The public IP address in Virtual WAN is assigned by the service based on the routing option selected. For more information about routing preference via Microsoft network or ISP, see the [Routing preference](../articles/virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-overview.md) article.
   * **Use Remote/On-premises RADIUS server** - 
        > [!NOTE]
        > The Remote/On-premises RADIUS server setting and related proxy IPs are only used if the Gateway is configured to use RADIUS-based authentication. If the Gateway is not configured to use RADIUS-based authentication, this setting will be ignored.

        When a Virtual WAN User VPN gateway is configured to use RADIUS-based authentication, the User VPN gateway acts as a proxy and sends RADIUS access requests to your RADIUS server. The "Use Remote/On-premises RADIUS server" setting is disabled by default, meaning the User VPN gateway will only be able to forward authentication requests to RADIUS servers in virtual networks connected to the gateway's hub. Enabling the setting will enable the User VPN gateway to authenticate with RADIUS servers connected to remote hubs or deployed on-premises.
  
       After updating the setting, navigate to the User VPN gateway and note the RADIUS proxy IPs field. The RADIUS proxy IPs are the source IPs of the RADIUS packets the User VPN gateway sends to your RADIUS server. Therefore, your RADIUS server needs to be configured to accept authentication requests from the RADIUS proxy IPs. If the RADIUS proxy IPs field is blank or none, configure the RADIUS server to accept authentication requests from the hub's address space.

   * **Client address pool** -  The address pool from which IP addresses will be automatically assigned to VPN clients. For more information, see [About client address pools](../articles/virtual-wan/about-client-address-pools.md).
   * **Custom DNS Servers** - The IP address of the DNS server(s) the clients will use. You can specify up to 5.

1. Select **Review + create** to validate your settings.

1. When validation passes, select **Create**. Creating a hub can take 30 minutes or more to complete.
