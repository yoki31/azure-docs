    If there are errors, any tab containing errors is marked with a red dot.  Navigate to the appropriate tab.  Fields containing an error will be highlighted in red.  Once all errors are fixed, select **Review and create** again.

1. Select **Create**.

    A page with the message *Deployment is in progress* is displayed.  Once the deployment is successfully completed, you'll see the message: *Your deployment is complete*.
