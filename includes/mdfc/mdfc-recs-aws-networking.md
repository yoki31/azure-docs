There are **36** AWS recommendations in this category.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|[Amazon EC2 should be configured to use VPC endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/e700ddd4-bb55-4602-b93a-d75895fbf7c6) |This control checks whether a service endpoint for Amazon EC2 is created for each VPC. The control fails if a VPC does not have a VPC endpoint created for the Amazon EC2 service. <br> To improve the security posture of your VPC, you can configure Amazon EC2 to use an interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to access Amazon EC2 API operations privately. It restricts all network traffic between your VPC and Amazon EC2 to the Amazon network. Because endpoints are supported within the same Region only, you cannot create an endpoint between a VPC and a service in a different Region. This prevents unintended Amazon EC2 API calls to other Regions. <br> To learn more about creating VPC endpoints for Amazon EC2, see <a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/interface-vpc-endpoints.html'>Amazon EC2 and interface VPC endpoints</a> in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. |Medium |
|[Amazon ECS services should not have public IP addresses assigned to them automatically](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/9bb205cd-a931-4f77-a620-0a263479732b) |A public IP address is an IP address that is reachable from the internet.<br> If you launch your Amazon ECS instances with a public IP address, then your Amazon ECS instances are reachable from the internet.<br> Amazon ECS services should not be publicly accessible, as this may allow unintended access to your container application servers. |High |
|[Amazon EMR cluster master nodes should not have public IP addresses](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/fe770214-7b47-48f7-a78c-1279c35d8279) |This control checks whether master nodes on Amazon EMR clusters have public IP addresses.<br>The control fails if the master node has public IP addresses that are associated with any of its instances. Public IP addresses are designated in the PublicIp field of the NetworkInterfaces configuration for the instance.<br> This control only checks Amazon EMR clusters that are in a RUNNING or WAITING state. |High |
|[Amazon Redshift clusters should use enhanced VPC routing](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1ee72ceb-2cb7-4686-84e6-0e1ac1c27241) |This control checks whether an Amazon Redshift cluster has EnhancedVpcRouting enabled.<br>Enhanced VPC routing forces all COPY and UNLOAD traffic between the cluster and data repositories to go through your VPC. You can then use VPC features such as security groups and network access control lists to secure network traffic. You can also use VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic. |High |
|[Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/fce0daac-96e4-47ab-ab35-18ac6b7dcc70) |To enforce encryption in transit, you should use redirect actions with Application Load Balancers to redirect client HTTP requests to an HTTPS request on port 443. |Medium |
|[Application load balancers should be configured to drop HTTP headers](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ca924610-5a8e-4c5e-9f17-8dff1ab1757b) |This control evaluates AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB) to ensure they are configured to drop invalid HTTP headers. The control fails if the value of routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled is set to false.<br>By default, ALBs are not configured to drop invalid HTTP header values. Removing these header values prevents HTTP desync attacks. |Medium |
|[Configure Lambda functions to a VPC](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/10445918-c305-4c6a-9851-250e8ec7b872) |This control checks whether a Lambda function is in a VPC. It does not evaluate the VPC subnet routing configuration to determine public reachability. <br> Note that if Lambda@Edge is found in the account, then this control generates failed findings. To prevent these findings, you can disable this control. |Low |
|[EC2 instances should not have a public IP address](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/63afb20c-4e8e-42ad-bc6d-dc48d4bebc5f) |This control checks whether EC2 instances have a public IP address. The control fails if the "publicIp" field is present in the EC2 instance configuration item. This control applies to IPv4 addresses only. <br> A public IPv4 address is an IP address that is reachable from the internet. If you launch your instance with a public IP address, then your EC2 instance is reachable from the internet. A private IPv4 address is an IP address that is not reachable from the internet. You can use private IPv4 addresses for communication between EC2 instances in the same VPC or in your connected private network. <br> IPv6 addresses are globally unique, and therefore are reachable from the internet. However, by default all subnets have the IPv6 addressing attribute set to false. For more information about IPv6, see <a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html'>IP addressing in your VPC</a> in the Amazon VPC User Guide. <br> If you have a legitimate use case to maintain EC2 instances with public IP addresses, then you can suppress the findings from this control. For more information about front-end architecture options, see the <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/'>AWS Architecture Blog</a> or the <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/'>This Is My Architecture series</a>. |High |
|[EC2 instances should not use multiple ENIs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/fead4128-7325-4b82-beda-3fd42de36920) |This control checks whether an EC2 instance uses multiple Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) or Elastic Fabric Adapters (EFAs).This control passes if a single network adapter is used. The control includes an optional parameter list to identify the allowed ENIs. <br>Multiple ENIs can cause dual-homed instances, meaning instances that have multiple subnets. This can add network security complexity and introduce unintended network paths and access. |Low |
|[EC2 instances should use IMDSv2](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/5ea3248a-8af5-4df3-8e08-f7d1925ea147) |This control checks whether your EC2 instance metadata version is configured with Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2). The control passes if "HttpTokens" is set to "required" for IMDSv2. The control fails if "HttpTokens" is set to "optional".  <br>You use instance metadata to configure or manage the running instance. The IMDS provides access to temporary, frequently rotated credentials. These credentials remove the need to hard code or distribute sensitive credentials to instances manually or programmatically. The IMDS is attached locally to every EC2 instance. It runs on a special 'link local' IP address of 169.254.169.254. This IP address is only accessible by software that runs on the instance.  <br>Version 2 of the IMDS adds new protections for the following types of vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be used to try to access the IMDS.<br>* Open website application firewalls <br>* Open reverse proxies <br>* Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities <br>* Open Layer 3 firewalls and network address translation (NAT) <br>Security Hub recommends that you configure your EC2 instances with IMDSv2. |High |
|[EC2 subnets should not automatically assign public IP addresses](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ace790eb-39b9-4b4f-b53d-26d0f77d4ab8) |This control checks whether the assignment of public IPs in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) subnets have "MapPublicIpOnLaunch" set to "FALSE". The control passes if the flag is set to "FALSE". <br> All subnets have an attribute that determines whether a network interface created in the subnet automatically receives a public IPv4 address. Instances that are launched into subnets that have this attribute enabled have a public IP address assigned to their primary network interface. |Medium |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Config configuration changes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/965a7c7f-e6da-4062-83f4-9c1800e51e44) |Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. <br> It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations. <br>Monitoring changes to AWS Config configuration will help ensure sustained visibility of configuration items within the AWS account. |Low |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Management Console authentication failures](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0e09bb35-54a3-48a1-855d-9fd3239deaf7) |Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. <br> It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for failed console authentication attempts. <br> Monitoring failed console logins may decrease lead time to detect an attempt to brute force a credential, which may provide an indicator, such as source IP, that can be used in other event correlation. |Low |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to Network Access Control Lists (NACL)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ec356185-75b9-4ff2-a284-9f64fc885e72) |Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for subnets within a VPC. <br> It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to NACLs. <br>Monitoring changes to NACLs will help ensure that AWS resources and services are not unintentionally exposed. |Low |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to network gateways](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c7156050-6f51-4d3f-a880-9f2363648cfb) |Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. Network gateways are required to send/receive traffic to a destination outside of a VPC. <br> It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to network gateways. <br>Monitoring changes to network gateways will help ensure that all ingress/egress traffic traverses the VPC border via a controlled path. |Low |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for CloudTrail configuration changes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0dc3b824-092a-4fc6-b8b4-31d5c2403024) |Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. <br> It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations. <br><br> Monitoring changes to CloudTrail's configuration will help ensure sustained visibility to activities performed in the AWS account. |Low |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for disabling or scheduled deletion of customer created CMKs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/d12e97c1-1f3e-4c69-8cc1-6e4cc6a9b167) |Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. <br> It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for customer created CMKs which have changed state to disabled or scheduled deletion. <br> Data encrypted with disabled or deleted keys will no longer be accessible. |Low |

Optionally the rule checks whether the port numbers are listed in the "authorizedTcpPorts" parameter.<br>- If the security group rule port number allows unrestricted incoming traffic, but the port number is specified in "authorizedTcpPorts", then the control passes. The default value for "authorizedTcpPorts" is <b>80, 443</b>.<br>- If the security group rule port number allows unrestricted incoming traffic, but the port number is not specified in authorizedTcpPorts input parameter, then the control fails.<br>- If the parameter is not used, then the control fails for any security group that has an unrestricted inbound rule.<br>Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS. Security group rules should follow the principal of least privileged access. Unrestricted access (IP address with a /0 suffix) increases the opportunity for malicious activity such as hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and loss of data.<br>Unless a port is specifically allowed, the port should deny unrestricted access. |High |
|[Unused EC2 EIPs should be removed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/601406b5-110c-41be-ad69-9c5661ba5f7c) |Elastic IP addresses that are allocated to a VPC should be attached to Amazon EC2 instances or in-use elastic network interfaces (ENIs). |Low |
