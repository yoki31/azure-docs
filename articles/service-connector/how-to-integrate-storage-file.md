# Integrate Azure File Storage with Service Connector

This page shows the supported authentication types and client types of Azure File Storage using Service Connector. You might still be able to connect to Azure File Storage in other programming languages without using Service Connector. This page also shows default environment variable name and value (or Spring Boot configuration) you get when you create the service connection. You can learn more about [Service Connector environment variable naming convention](concept-service-connector-internals.md).

## Supported compute service

- Azure App Service
- Azure Spring Cloud
