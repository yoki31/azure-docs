# Service Connector internals

Service Connector is an extension resource provider that provides an easy way to create and manage connections between services.
- Support major databases, storage, real-time services, state, and secret stores that are used together with your cloud native application (the list is actively expanding).
- Configure network settings, authentication, and manage connection environment variables or properties by creating a service connection with just a single command or a few clicks.
- Validate connections and find corresponding suggestions to fix a service connection. 

## Service connection overview

Service connection is the key concept in the resource model of Service Connector. In Service Connector, a service connection represents an abstraction of the link between two services. The following properties are defined on service connection.

| Property | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| Connection Name | The unique name of the service connection.  |
| Source Service Type | Source services are usually Azure compute services. Service Connector functionalities can be found in supported compute services by extending these Azure compute service providers.  |
| Target Service Type | Target services are backing services or dependency services that your compute services connect to. Service Connector supports various target service types including major databases, storage, real-time services, state, and secret stores. |
| Client Type | Client type refers your compute runtime stack, development framework, or specific client library type, which accepts the specific format of the connection environment variables or properties. |
| Authentication Type | The authentication type used of service connection. It could be pure secret/connection string, Managed Identity, or Service Principal. |

You can create multiple service connections from one source service instance if your instance needs to connect multiple target resources. And the same target resource can be connected from multiple source instances. Service Connector will manage all connections in the properties of their source instance. Thatâ€™s means you can create, get, update, and delete the connections in portal or CLI command of their source service instance. 

The connection support cross subscription or tenant. Source and target service can belong to different subscriptions or tenants. When you create a new service connection, the connection resource is in the same region with your compute service instance by default.

## Create or update a service connection

Service Connector will do multiple steps while creating or updating a connection, including:

- Configure target resource network and firewall settings, making sure source and target services can talk to each other in network level.
- Configure connection information on source resource
- Configure authentication information on source and target if needed
- Create or update connection support rollback if failure.

Creating and updating a connection contains multiple steps. If any step failed, Service Connector will roll back all previous steps to keep the initial settings in source and target instances.

## Connection configurations

Once a service connection is created, the connection configuration will be set to the source service.
In portal, navigate to **Service Connector (Preview)** page. You can expand each connection and view the connection configurations.

In CLI, you can use `list-configuration` command to view the connection configuration.

```azurecli
az webapp connection list-configuration -g {webapp_rg} -n {webapp_name} --connection {service_connection_name}
```

```azurecli
az spring-cloud connection list-configuration -g {spring_cloud_rg} -n {spring_cloud_name} --connection {service_connection_name}
```

## Configuration naming convention

Service Connector sets configuration (environment variables or Spring Boot configurations) when creating a connection. The environment variable key-value pair(s) are determined by your client type and authentication type. E.g., Using Azure SDK with managed identity requires client ID, client secret, etc. Using JDBC driver requires database connection string. The naming rule of the configuration are as following.

If you are using **Spring Boot** as the client type:

* Spring Boot library for each target service has its own naming convention. E.g., MySQL connection settings would be `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, `spring.datasource.password`. Kafka connection settings would be `spring.kafka.properties.bootstrap.servers`.

If you using **other client types** except Spring Boot:

* When connect to a target service, the key name of the first connection configuration is in format as `{Cloud}_{Type}_{Name}`. E.g., `AZURE_STORAGEBLOB_RESOURCEENDPOINT`, `CONFLUENTCLOUD_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAPSERVER`. 
* For the same type of target resource, the key name of the second connection configuration will be format as `{Cloud}_{Type}_{Connection Name}_{Name}`. E.g., `AZURE_STORAGEBLOB_CONN2_RESOURCEENDPOINT`, `CONFLUENTCLOUD_KAFKA_CONN2_BOOTSTRAPSERVER`.

## Validate a service connection
The following items will be checked while validating the connection:

* Validate whether source and target resources exist
* Validate target resource network and firewall settings
* Validate connection information on source resource
* Validate authentication information on source and target if needed

## Delete connection

The connection information on source resource will be deleted when deleting connection.
