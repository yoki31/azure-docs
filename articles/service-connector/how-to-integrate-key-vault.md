# Integrate Azure Key Vault with Service Connector

> [!NOTE]
> When you use Service Connector to connect your key vault or manage key vault connections, Service Connector will be using your token to perform the corresponding operations.

This page shows the supported authentication types and client types of Azure Key Vault using Service Connector. You might still be able to connect to Azure Key Vault in other programming languages without using Service Connector. This page also shows default environment variable name and value (or Spring Boot configuration) you get when you create the service connection. You can learn more about [Service Connector environment variable naming convention](concept-service-connector-internals.md).

## Supported compute service

- Azure App Service
- Azure Spring Cloud
