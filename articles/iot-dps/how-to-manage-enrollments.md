# How to manage device enrollments with Azure portal

A *device enrollment* creates a record of a single device or a group of devices that may at some point register with the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS). The enrollment record contains the initial configuration for the device(s) as part of that enrollment. Included in the configuration is either the IoT hub to which a device will be assigned, or an allocation policy that configures the hub from a set of hubs. This article shows you how to manage device enrollments for your provisioning service.

The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments:

* [Enrollment groups](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group): Used to enroll multiple related devices.
* [Individual enrollments](concepts-service.md#individual-enrollment): Used to enroll a single device.

## Create an enrollment group

 An enrollment group is an entry for a group of devices that share a common attestation mechanism. We recommend that you use an enrollment group for a large number of devices that share an initial configuration, or for devices that go to the same tenant. Devices that use either [symmetric key](concepts-symmetric-key-attestation.md) or [X.509 certificates](concepts-x509-attestation.md) attestation are supported.

### Create a symmetric key enrollment group

To create and use enrollment groups with symmetric keys, see the [Provision devices with symmetric keys](how-to-legacy-device-symm-key.md) tutorial.

To create a symmetric key enrollment group:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the left-hand menu or on the portal page, select **All resources**.

3. Select the Device Provisioning Service to which you want to enroll your device.

4. In the **Settings** menu, select **Manage enrollments**.

5. At the top of the page, select **+ Add enrollment group**.

6. In the **Add Enrollment Group** page, enter the following information:

   | Field | Description |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Group name** | The name of the group of devices. The enrollment group name is a case-insensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`).|
    | **Attestation Type** |Select **Symmetric Key**.|
    | **Auto Generate Keys** |Check this box.|
    | **Select how you want to assign devices to hubs** |Select *Static configuration* so that you can assign to a specific hub|
    | **Select the IoT hubs this group can be assigned to** |Select one of your hubs.|

    Leave the rest of the fields at their default values.

7. Select **Save**.

### Create a X.509 certificate enrollment group

To create a X.509 certificate enrollment group:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the left-hand menu or on the portal page, select **All resources**.

3. Select the Device Provisioning Service to which you want to enroll your device.

4. In the **Settings** menu, select **Manage enrollments**.

5. At the top of the page, select **+ Add enrollment group**.

6. In the **Add Enrollment Group** page, enter the following information:

    | Field | Description |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Group name** | The name of the group of devices.|
    | **Attestation Type** |Select **Certificate**.|
    | **Certificate Type** | Select **CA Certificate** or **Intermediate** based on which certificate signed your device certificates.|
    | **Primary Certificate**| If you're signing your device certificates with a CA certificate, then the root CA certificate must have [proof of possession](how-to-verify-certificates.md) completed. If you're signing your device certificates with an intermediate certificate, an upload button will be available to allow you to upload your intermediate certificate. The certificate that signed the intermediate must also have [proof of possession](how-to-verify-certificates.md) completed.

    Leave the rest of the fields at their default values.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-enrollments/add-enrollment-group-cert.png" alt-text="Add enrollment group for CA certificate attestation.":::

7. Select **Save**.

## Create an individual enrollment

An individual enrollment is an entry for a single device that may be assigned to an IoT hub. Devices using [symmetric key](concepts-symmetric-key-attestation.md), [X.509 certificates](concepts-x509-attestation.md), and [TPM attestation](concepts-tpm-attestation.md) are supported.
