# Quickstart: Provision an X.509 certificate simulated device

In this quickstart, you'll create a simulated device on your Windows machine. The simulated device will be configured to use the [X.509 certificate attestation](concepts-x509-attestation.md) mechanism for authentication. After you've configured your device, you'll then provision it to your IoT hub using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service.

If you're unfamiliar with the process of provisioning, review the [provisioning](about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) overview.  Also make sure you've completed the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before continuing.

This quickstart demonstrates a solution for a Windows-based workstation. However, you can also perform the procedures on Linux. For a Linux example, see [How to provision for multitenancy](how-to-provision-multitenant.md).

## Prepare your development environment

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you'll prepare a development environment that's used to build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). The sample code attempts to provision the device, during the device's boot sequence.

1. Download the latest [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Confirm that the Visual Studio prerequisites (Visual Studio and the 'Desktop development with C++' workload) are installed on your machine, **before** starting the `CMake` installation. Once the prerequisites are in place, and the download is verified, install the CMake build system. Also, be aware that older versions of the CMake build system fail to generate the solution file used in this article. Make sure to use the latest version of CMake.

2. Open a web browser, and go to the [Release page of the Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest).

3. Select the **Tags** tab at the top of the page.

4. Copy the tag name for the latest release of the Azure IoT C SDK.

5. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. (replace `<release-tag>` with the tag you copied in the previous step).

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    This operation could take several minutes to complete.

6. When the operation is complete, run the following commands from the `azure-iot-sdk-c` directory:

    ```cmd/sh
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

7. The code sample uses an X.509 certificate to provide attestation via X.509 authentication. Run the following command to build a version of the SDK specific to your development platform that includes the device provisioning client. A Visual Studio solution for the simulated device is generated in the `cmake` directory.

    ```cmd
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON ..
    ```

    >[!TIP]
    >If `cmake` does not find your C++ compiler, you may get build errors while running the above command. If that happens, try running the command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

8. When the build succeeds, the last few output lines look similar to the following output:

    ```cmd/sh
    $ cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON ..
    -- Building for: Visual Studio 16 2019
    -- The C compiler identification is MSVC 19.23.28107.0
    -- The CXX compiler identification is MSVC 19.23.28107.0

    ...

::: zone-end

## Create a self-signed X.509 device certificate

In this section, you'll use sample code from the Azure IoT SDK to create a self-signed X.509 certificate. This certificate must be uploaded to your provisioning service, and verified by the service.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use certificates created with the SDK tooling for development testing only.
> Do not use these certificates in production.
> The SDK generated certificates contain hard-coded passwords, such as *1234*, and expire after 30 days.
> To learn about obtaining certificates suitable for production use, see [How to get an X.509 CA certificate](../iot-hub/iot-hub-x509ca-overview.md#how-to-get-an-x509-ca-certificate) in the Azure IoT Hub documentation.
>

To create the X.509 certificate:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

### Clone the Azure IoT C SDK

The [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) contains test tooling that can help you create an X.509 certificate chain, upload a root or intermediate certificate from that chain, and do proof-of-possession with the service to verify the certificate.

If you've already cloned the latest release of the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository, skip to the [next section](#create-a-test-certificate).

1. Open a web browser, and go to the [Release page of the Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest).

2. Copy the tag name for the latest release of the Azure IoT C SDK.

3. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. (replace `<release-tag>` with the tag you copied in the previous step).

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    This operation may take several minutes to complete.

4. The test tooling should now be located in the *azure-iot-sdk-c/tools/CACertificates* of the repository that you cloned.

### Create a test certificate

Follow the steps in [Managing test CA certificates for samples and tutorials](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md).

In addition to the tooling in the C SDK, the [Group certificate verification sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp/tree/master/provisioning/Samples/service/GroupCertificateVerificationSample) in the *Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for .NET* shows how to do proof-of-possession in C# with an existing X.509 intermediate or root CA certificate.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

1. In a PowerShell prompt, change directories to the project directory for the X.509 device provisioning sample.

    ```powershell
    cd .\azure-iot-samples-csharp\provisioning\Samples\device\X509Sample
    ```

2. The sample code is set up to use X.509 certificates that are stored within a password-protected PKCS12 formatted file (`certificate.pfx`). Additionally, you'll need a public key certificate file (`certificate.cer`) to create an individual enrollment later in this quickstart. To generate the self-signed certificate and its associated `.cer` and `.pfx` files, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    PS D:\azure-iot-samples-csharp\provisioning\Samples\device\X509Sample> .\GenerateTestCertificate.ps1 iothubx509device1
    ```

    The certificate generated by this command has a subject common name (CN) of _iothubx509device1_. For X.509-based enrollments, the [Registration ID](./concepts-service.md#registration-id) is set to the common name. The registration ID is a case-insensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). The common name must adhere to this format.

3. The script prompts you for a PFX password. Remember this password, as you will use it later when you run the sample. Optionally, you can run `certutil` to dump the certificate and verify the subject name.

    ```powershell
    PS D:\azure-iot-samples-csharp\provisioning\Samples\device\X509Sample> certutil .\certificate.pfx
    Enter PFX password:
    ================ Certificate 0 ================

::: zone pivot="programming-language-nodejs"

1. Open a command prompt, and go to the certificate generator script and build the project:

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-node/provisioning/tools
    npm install
    ```

2. Create a _leaf_ X.509 certificate by running the script using your own _certificate-name_. For X.509-based enrollments, the leaf certificate's common name becomes the [Registration ID](./concepts-service.md#registration-id). The registration ID is a case-insensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). The _certificate-name_ parameter must adhere to this format.

    ```cmd/sh
    node create_test_cert.js device {certificate-name}
    ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

1. In the Git Bash prompt, run the following command:

    # [Windows](#tab/windows)

    ```bash
    winpty openssl req -outform PEM -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./python-device.key.pem -out ./python-device.pem -days 365 -extensions usr_cert -subj "//CN=Python-device-01"
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=Python-device-01`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms.

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)

    ```bash
    openssl req -outform PEM -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./python-device.key.pem -out ./python-device.pem -days 365 -extensions usr_cert -subj "/CN=Python-device-01"
    ```

    ---

2. When asked to **Enter PEM pass phrase:**, use the pass phrase `1234`.

3. When asked **Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:**, use the pass phrase `1234` again.

A test certificate file (*python-device.pem*) and private key file (*python-device.key.pem*) should now be generated in the directory where you ran the `openssl` command.

The certificate file has its subject common name (CN) set to `Python-device-01`. For an X.509-based enrollments, the [Registration ID](./concepts-service.md#registration-id) is set to the common name. The registration ID is a case-insensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). The common name must adhere to this format.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

1. Using the command prompt from previous steps, go to the `target` folder.

2. Run the .jar file created in the previous section.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd target
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-cert-generator-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```

3. Enter **N** for _Do you want to input common name_. This creates a certificate with a subject common name (CN) of _microsoftriotcore_.

    For an X.509-based enrollments, the [Registration ID](./concepts-service.md#registration-id) is set to the common name. The registration ID is a case-insensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). The common name must adhere to this format.

4. Copy the output of `Client Cert` to the clipboard, starting from *-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----* through *-----END CERTIFICATE-----*.

   ![Individual certificate generator](./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/cert-generator-java.png)

5. Create a file named *_X509individual.pem_* on your Windows machine.

6. Open *_X509individual.pem_* in an editor of your choice, and copy the clipboard contents to this file.

7. Save the file and close your editor.

8. In the command prompt, enter **N** for _Do you want to input Verification Code_ and keep the program output open for reference later in the quickstart. Copy the `Client Cert` and `Client Cert Private Key` values, for use in the next section.

8. Select **Individual Enrollments**. Your X.509 enrollment entry should appear in the registration table.

## Prepare and run the device provisioning code

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, we'll update the sample code to send the device's boot sequence to your Device Provisioning Service instance. This boot sequence will cause the device to be recognized and assigned to an IoT hub linked to the Device Provisioning Service instance.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

2. Copy the **_ID Scope_** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Copy ID Scope from the portal.":::

3. In Visual Studio's *Solution Explorer* window, navigate to the **Provision\_Samples** folder. Expand the sample project named **prov\_dev\_client\_sample**. Expand **Source Files**, and open **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c**.

4. Find the `id_scope` constant, and replace the value with your **ID Scope** value that you copied earlier.

    ```c
    static const char* id_scope = "0ne00002193";
    ```

5. Find the definition for the `main()` function in the same file. Make sure the `hsm_type` variable is set to `SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509` instead of `SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM` as shown below.

    ```c
    SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE hsm_type;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM;
    hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509;
    ```

6. Right-click the **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.

7. On the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start without debugging** to run the solution. In the prompt to rebuild the project, select **Yes** to rebuild the project before running.

    The following output is an example of the provisioning device client sample successfully booting up, and connecting to the provisioning Service instance to get IoT hub information and registering:

    ```cmd
    Provisioning API Version: 1.2.7

    Registering... Press enter key to interrupt.

    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_CONNECTED
    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_ASSIGNING

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Copy ID Scope from the portal.":::

3. Open a command prompt window.

4. Type the following command to build and run the X.509 device provisioning sample (replace the `<IDScope>` value with the ID Scope that you copied in the previous section.). The certificate file will default to *./certificate.pfx* and prompt for the .pfx password. Type in your password.

    ```powershell
    dotnet run -- -s <IDScope>
    ```

    If you want to pass everything as a parameter, you can use the following example format.

    ```powershell
    dotnet run -- -s 0ne00000A0A -c certificate.pfx -p 1234
    ```

5. The device will now connect to DPS and be assigned to an IoT Hub. Then, the device will send a telemetry message to the hub.

    ```output

The Python provisioning sample, [provision_x509.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/main/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py) is located in the `azure-iot-sdk-python/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios` directory. This sample uses six environment variables to authenticate and provision an IoT device using DPS. These environment variables are:

| Variable name              | Description                                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `PROVISIONING_HOST`        |  This value is the global endpoint used for connecting to your DPS resource |
| `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE`     |  This value is the ID Scope for your DPS resource |
| `DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID` |  This value is the ID for your device. It must also match the subject name on the device certificate |
| `X509_CERT_FILE`           |  Your device certificate filename |
| `X509_KEY_FILE`            |  The private key filename for your device certificate |
| `PASS_PHRASE`              |  The pass phrase you used to encrypt the certificate and private key file (`1234`). |

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

2. Copy the **_ID Scope_** and **Global device endpoint** values.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope-and-global-device-endpoint.png" alt-text="Copy ID Scope from the portal.":::

3. In your Git Bash prompt, use the following commands to add the environment variables for the global device endpoint and ID Scope.

    ```bash
    $export PROVISIONING_HOST=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    $export PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE=<ID scope for your DPS resource>
    ```

4. The registration ID for the IoT device must match subject name on its device certificate. If you generated a self-signed test certificate, `Python-device-01` is both the subject name and the registration ID for the device.

    If you already have a device certificate, you can use `certutil` to verify the subject common name used for your device, as shown below:

    ```bash
    $ certutil python-device.pem
    X509 Certificate:
    Version: 3
    Serial Number: fa33152fe1140dc8
    Signature Algorithm:
        Algorithm ObjectId: 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11 sha256RSA
        Algorithm Parameters:
        05 00
    Issuer:
        CN=Python-device-01
      Name Hash(sha1): 1dd88de40e9501fb64892b698afe12d027011000
      Name Hash(md5): a62c784820daa931b9d3977739b30d12

     NotBefore: 1/29/2021 7:05 PM
     NotAfter: 1/29/2022 7:05 PM

    Subject:
        ===> CN=Python-device-01 <===
      Name Hash(sha1): 1dd88de40e9501fb64892b698afe12d027011000
      Name Hash(md5): a62c784820daa931b9d3977739b30d12
    ```

5. In the Git Bash prompt, set the environment variable for the registration ID as follows:

    ```bash
    $export DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID=Python-device-01
    ```

6. In the Git Bash prompt, set the environment variables for the certificate file, private key file, and pass phrase.

    ```bash
    $export X509_CERT_FILE=./python-device.pem
    $export X509_KEY_FILE=./python-device.key.pem
    $export PASS_PHRASE=1234
    ```

7. Review the code for [provision_x509.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/main/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py). If you're not using **Python version 3.7** or later, make the [code change mentioned here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/main/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios#advanced-iot-hub-scenario-samples-for-the-azure-iot-hub-device-sdk) to replace `asyncio.run(main())`.

8. Save your changes.

9. Run the sample. The sample will connect, provision the device to a hub, and send some test messages to the hub.

    ```bash
    $ winpty python azure-iot-sdk-python/azure-iot-device/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py
    RegistrationStage(RequestAndResponseOperation): Op will transition into polling after interval 2.  Setting timer.
    The complete registration result is

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope-and-global-device-endpoint.png" alt-text="Copy ID Scope from the portal.":::

3. Open a command prompt. Navigate to the sample project folder of the Java SDK repository.

    ```cmd/sh
    cd azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-samples/provisioning-X509-sample
    ```

4. Enter the provisioning service and X.509 identity information in your code. This is used during provisioning, for attestation of the simulated device, prior to device registration:

   * Edit the file `/src/main/java/samples/com/microsoft/azure/sdk/iot/ProvisioningX509Sample.java`, to include your _ID Scope_ and _Provisioning Service Global Endpoint_ as noted previously. Also include _Client Cert_ and _Client Cert Private Key_ as noted in the previous section.

      ```java
      private static final String idScope = "[Your ID scope here]";
      private static final String globalEndpoint = "[Your Provisioning Service Global Endpoint here]";
      private static final ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol PROVISIONING_DEVICE_CLIENT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL = ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol.HTTPS;
      private static final String leafPublicPem = "<Your Public PEM Certificate here>";
      private static final String leafPrivateKey = "<Your Private PEM Key here>";
      ```

   * Use the following format when copying/pasting your certificate and private key:

      ```java
      private static final String leafPublicPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "+XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";
      private static final String leafPrivateKey = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "XXXXXXXXXX\n" +
            "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n";
      ```

5. Build the sample, and then go to the `target` folder and execute the created .jar file.

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean install
    cd target
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar
    ```
