### Record calls
> [!NOTE]
> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment. To use this api please use 'beta' release of ACS Calling Web SDK

Call recording is an extended feature of the core `Call` API. You first need to import calling Features from the Calling SDK:

```js
import { Features} from "@azure/communication-calling";
```

Then you can get the recording feature API object from the call instance:

```js
const callTransferApi = call.feature(Features.Recording);
```

Then, to check if the call is being recorded, inspect the `isRecordingActive` property of `callRecordingApi`. It returns `Boolean`.

```js
const isRecordingActive = callRecordingApi.isRecordingActive;
```

You can also subscribe to recording changes:

```js
const isRecordingActiveChangedHandler = () => {
    console.log(callRecordingApi.isRecordingActive);
};

callRecordingApi.on('isRecordingActiveChanged', isRecordingActiveChangedHandler);
```
