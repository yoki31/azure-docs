# Media Streaming and Composition
[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Notice](../../includes/private-preview-include.md)]

Azure Communication Services Media Streaming and Composition enables you to build dynamic voice and video calling experiences at large scales, suitable for interactive streaming, virtual events, and broadcast scenarios. In a common video calling scenario, each participant is uploading several media streams captured from:

- Cameras
- Microphones
- Applications (screen sharing)

These media streams are typically arrayed in a grid and broadcast to call participants. Media Streaming and Composition allows you to extend and enhance this experience:

- Connect devices and services using streaming protocols such as [RTMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7016) or [SRT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sharabayko-srt)
- Compose media streams into complex scenes

RTMP & SRT connectivity can be used for both input and output. Using RTMP/SRT input, a videography studio that emits RTMP/SRT can join an Azure Communication Services call. RTMP/SRT output allows you to stream media from Azure Communication Services into [Azure Media Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/concepts-overview), YouTube Live, and many other broadcasting channels. The ability to attach industry standard RTMP/SRT emitters and to output content to RTMP/SRT subscribers for broadcasting transforms a small group call into a virtual event that reaches millions of people in real time.

Media Composition REST APIs (and open-source SDKs) allow you to command the Azure service to cloud compose these media streams. For example, a **presenter layout** can be used to compose a speaker and a translator together in a classic picture-in-picture style. Media Composition allows for all clients and services connected to the media data plane to enjoy a particular dynamic layout without local processing or application complexity.

 In the diagram below, three endpoints are participating actively in a group call and uploading media. Two users, one of which is using Microsoft Teams, are composed using a *presenter layout.*  The third endpoint is a television studio that emits RTMP into the call. The Azure Calling client and Teams client will receive the composed media stream instead of a typical grid. Additionally, Azure Media Services is shown here subscribing to the call's RTMP channel and broadcasting content externally.

This functionality is activated through REST APIs and open-source SDKs. Below is an example of the JSON encoded configuration of a presenter layout for the above scenario:

```
{
  layout: {
    type: ‘presenter’,
    presenter: {
      supportPosition: ‘right’,
      primarySource: ‘1’, // source id
    }
  },
  sources: [
    { id: ‘1’ }, { id: ‘2’ }
  ]
}

```
The presenter layout is one of several layouts available through the media composition capability:

- **Grid** - This is the typical video calling layout, where all media sources are shown on a grid with similar sizes. You can use the grid layout to specify grid positions and size.
- **Presentation.** Similar to the grid layout but media sources can have different sizes, allowing for emphasis.
- **Presenter** - This layout overlays two sources on top of each other.
- **Weather Person** - This layout overlays two sources, but in real-time Azure will remove the background behind people.
