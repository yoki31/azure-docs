# Exception Policy

[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/private-preview-include-section.md)]

An Exception Policy is a set of rules that defines what actions to execute when a condition is triggered.  You can save these policies inside Job Router and the attach them to one or more Queues.

## Triggers

The following triggers can be used to drive actions:

**Queue Length -** Fires when the length of the queue exceeds a specified threshold while adding the job to the queue.

**Wait Time -** Fires when the job has been waiting in the queue for the specified threshold.

When these triggers are fired, they'll execute one or more actions and send an [Exception Triggered Event][exception_triggered_event] via [Event Grid][subscribe_events].

## Actions

**Cancel -** Cancels the job and removes it from the queue.

**Reclassify -** Reapplies the specified Classification Policy with modified labels to the job.

**Manual Reclassify -** Modifies the queue, priority, and worker selectors to the job.

## Examples

In the following example, we configure an Exception Policy that will cancel a job before it joins a queue with a length greater than 100.

```csharp
await client.SetExceptionPolicyAsync(
    id: "policy-1",
    name: "My Exception Policy",
    rules: new List<ExceptionRule>
    {
        new ExceptionRule(
            id: "rule-1",
            trigger: new QueueLengthExceptionTrigger(threshold: 100),
            actions: new List<ExceptionAction>
            {
                new CancelExceptionAction("cancel-action")
            })
    });
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"

```typescript
await client.upsertExceptionPolicy({
        id: "policy-1",
        name: "My Exception Policy",
        exceptionRules: [
            { 
                id: "rule-1",
                trigger: { kind: "queue-length", threshold: 100 },
                actions: [
                    { kind: "cancel", id: "cancel-action" }
                ]
            }
        ]
    });
```

::: zone-end

In the following example, we configure an Exception Policy with rules that will:

- Set the job priority to 10 after it has been waiting in the queue for 1 minute.
- Move the job to `queue-2` after it has been waiting for 5 minutes.

```csharp
await client.SetExceptionPolicyAsync(
    id: "policy-1",
    name: "My Exception Policy",
    rules: new List<ExceptionRule>
    {
        new ExceptionRule(
            id: "rule-1",
            trigger: new WaitTimeExceptionTrigger(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)),
            actions: new List<ExceptionAction>
            {
                new ManualReclassifyExceptionAction(id: "action1", priority: 10)
            }),
        new ExceptionRule(
            id: "rule-2",
            trigger: new WaitTimeExceptionTrigger(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)),
            actions: new List<ExceptionAction>
            {
                new ManualReclassifyExceptionAction(id: "action2", queueId: "queue-2")
            })
    });
```

                ]
