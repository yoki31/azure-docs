> [!NOTE]
> Find the finalized code for this quickstart on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-python-quickstarts/tree/main/get-relay-configuration-quickstart)

## Prerequisites for Python

 An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7 or 3.6+.
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting Up

### Create a new Python application

1. Open your terminal or command window create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

   ```console
   mkdir access-tokens-quickstart && cd relay-tokens-quickstart
   ```

2. Use a text editor to create a file called **issue-relay-tokens.py** in the project root directory and add the structure for the program, including basic exception handling. You'll add all the source code for this quickstart to this file in the following sections.

   ```python
    import os
    from azure.communication.networktraversal import CommunicationRelayClient
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.communication.identity import CommunicationIdentityClient
    
    try:
      print("Azure Communication Services - Access Relay Configuration  Quickstart")
      # Quickstart code goes here
    except Exception as ex:
      print("Exception:")
      print(ex)
   ```

### Install the package

While still in the application directory, install the Azure Communication Services Identity SDK for Python package by using the `pip install` command.

```console
pip install azure-communication-identity
pip install azure.communication.networktraversal
```

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a `CommunicationIdentityClient` with your resource's access key and endpoint. The code below retrieves the connection string for the resource from an environment variable named `COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING`. Learn how to [manage your resource's connection string](../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string). 

Add this code inside the `try` block:

```python

# You can find your endpoint and access token from your resource in the Azure Portal
connection_str = "endpoint=ENDPOINT;accessKey=KEY"
endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com"

# To use Azure Active Directory Authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) make sure to have
# AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as env variables.
# We also need Identity client to get a User Identifier
identity_client = CommunicationIdentityClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())
relay_client = CommunicationRelayClient(endpoint, DefaultAzureCredential())

#You can also authenticate using your connection string
identity_client = CommunicationIdentityClient.from_connection_string(self.connection_string)
relay_client = CommunicationRelayClient.from_connection_string(self.connection_string)
```

## Create a user from identity 

Azure Communication Services maintains a lightweight identity directory. Use the `create_user` method to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id`. Store received identity with mapping to your application's users. For example, by storing them in your application server's database. The identity is required later to issue access tokens.

```python
user = identity_client.create_user()
```

## Getting the relay configuration
Call the Azure Communication token service to exchange the user access token for a TURN service token

```python
relay_configuration = relay_client.get_relay_configuration(user)

for iceServer in config.ice_servers:
    assert iceServer.username is not None
    print('Username: ' + iceServer.username)

    assert iceServer.credential is not None
    print('Credential: ' + iceServer.credential)
    
    assert iceServer.urls is not None
    for url in iceServer.urls:
        print('Url:' + url)
```     

## Run the code

From a console prompt, navigate to the directory containing the *issue-relay-tokens.py* file, then execute the following `python` command to run the app.

```console
python ./issue-relay-tokens.py
```
