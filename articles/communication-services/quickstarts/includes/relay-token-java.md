> [!NOTE]
> Find the finalized code for this quickstart on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-java-quickstarts/tree/main/get-relay-config-quickstart)

## Prerequisites for Java

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-install) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting Up

### Create a new Java application

Open your terminal or command window. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to create your Java application. Run the command below to generate the Java project from the maven-archetype-quickstart template.

```console
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.communication.quickstart -DartifactId=communication-quickstart -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

You'll notice that the 'generate' task created a directory with the same name as the `artifactId`. Under this directory, the src/main/java directory contains the project source code, the `src/test/java directory` contains the test source, and the `pom.xml` file is the project's Project Object Model, or POM.

### Install the package

Open the **pom.xml** file in your text editor. Add the following dependency element to the group of dependencies.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-identity</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Set up the app framework 

From the project directory:

1. Navigate to the `/src/main/java/com/communication/quickstart` directory
2. Open the `App.java` file in your editor
3. Replace the `System.out.println("Hello world!");` statement
4. Add `import` directives

Use the following code to begin:

```java
package com.communication.quickstart;

import com.azure.communication.common.*;
import com.azure.communication.identity.*;
import com.azure.communication.identity.models.*;
import com.azure.core.credential.*;
import com.communication.network.traversal.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.time.*;
import java.util.*;

public class App
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    {
        System.out.println("Azure Communication Services - Network Credentials Quickstart");
        // Quickstart code goes here
    }
}
```

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a `CommunicationIdentityClient` with your resource's access key and endpoint. Learn how to [manage your resource's connection string](../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string). In addition, you can initialize the client with any custom HTTP client the implements the `com.azure.core.http.HttpClient` interface.

Add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// Your can find your endpoint and access key from your resource in the Azure portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";
String accessKey = "SECRET";

CommunicationRelayClient communicationRelayClient = new CommunicationRelayClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildClient();

```

You can also provide the entire connection string using the `connectionString()` function instead of providing the endpoint and access key.
```java
// Your can find your connection string from your resource in the Azure portal
String connectionString = "<connection_string>";

CommunicationRelayClient communicationRelayClient = new CommunicationRelayClientBuilder()
    .connectionString(connectionString)
    .buildClient();
```

## Create an identity

Azure Communication Services maintains a lightweight identity directory. Use the `createUser` method to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id`. Store received identity with mapping to your application's users. For example, by storing them in your application server's database. The identity is required later to issue access tokens.

```java
CommunicationUserIdentifier user = communicationIdentityClient.createUser();
System.out.println("\nCreated an identity with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Getting the relay configuration
Call the Azure Communication token service to exchange the user access token for a TURN service token

```java
CommunicationIdentityClient communicationIdentityClient = new CommunicationIdentityClientBuilder()
            .connectionString(connectionString)
            .buildClient();

CommunicationUserIdentifier user = communicationIdentityClient.createUser();
System.out.println("User id: " + user.getId());

CommunicationRelayConfiguration config = communicationRelayClient.getRelayConfiguration(user);
        
        System.out.println("Expires on:" + config.getExpiresOn());
        List<CommunicationIceServer> iceServers = config.getIceServers();

        for (CommunicationIceServer iceS : iceServers) {
            System.out.println("URLS: " + iceS.getUrls());
            System.out.println("Username: " + iceS.getUsername());
            System.out.println("Credential: " + iceS.getCredential());
        } 
```

## Run the code

Navigate to the directory containing the *pom.xml* file and compile the project by using the following `mvn` command.

```console
mvn compile
```

Then, build the package.

```console
mvn package
```

Run the following `mvn` command to execute the app.

Navigate to the directory containing the *pom.xml* file and compile the project by using the following `mvn` command.

```console
mvn compile
```

Then, build the package.

```console
mvn package
```

Run the following `mvn` command to execute the app.

```console
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.communication.quickstart.App" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
```
