# Quickstart: Custom Named Entity Recognition (preview)

In this article, we use the Language studio to demonstrate key concepts of custom Named Entity Recognition (NER). As an example weâ€™ll build a custom NER model to extract relevant entities from loan agreements.

::: zone pivot="language-studio"

[!INCLUDE [Language Studio quickstart](includes/quickstarts/language-studio.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="rest-api"

[!INCLUDE [REST API quickstart](includes/quickstarts/rest-api.md)]

::: zone-end

## Next steps

After you've created entity extraction model, you can:

* [Use the runtime API to extract entities](how-to/call-api.md)

When you start to create your own entity classification projects, use the how-to articles to learn more about developing your model in greater detail:

* [Data selection and schema design](how-to/design-schema.md)
* [Tag data](how-to/tag-data.md)
* [Train a model](how-to/train-model.md)
* [View model evaluation](how-to/view-model-evaluation.md)
* [Improve a model](how-to/improve-model.md)
