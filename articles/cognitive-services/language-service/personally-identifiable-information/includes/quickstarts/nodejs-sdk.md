[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-text-analytics-readme?preserve-view=true&view=azure-node-latest) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics) | [Package (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-text-analytics/v/5.1.0) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp 

cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the NPM package:

```console
npm install @azure/ai-text-analytics@5.1.0
```

## Code example

Open the file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. 

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-text-analytics");
const key = '<paste-your-key-here>';
const endpoint = '<paste-your-endpoint-here>';
// Authenticate the client with your key and endpoint
const textAnalyticsClient = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint,  new AzureKeyCredential(key));

// Example method for detecting sensitive information (PII) from text 
async function piiRecognition(client) {

    const documents = [
        "The employee's phone number is (555) 555-5555."
    ];

    const results = await client.recognizePiiEntities(documents, "en");
    for (const result of results) {
        if (result.error === undefined) {
            console.log("Redacted Text: ", result.redactedText);
            console.log(" -- Recognized PII entities for input", result.id, "--");
            for (const entity of result.entities) {
                console.log(entity.text, ":", entity.category, "(Score:", entity.confidenceScore, ")");
            }
        } else {
            console.error("Encountered an error:", result.error);
        }
    }
}
piiRecognition(textAnalyticsClient)
```

## Output

```console
Redacted Text:  The employee's phone number is **************.
 -- Recognized PII entities for input 0 --
(555) 555-5555 : Phone Number (Score: 0.8 )
```
