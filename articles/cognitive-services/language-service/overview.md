# What is Azure Cognitive Service for Language?

Azure Cognitive Service for Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. Use this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries.  

This Language service unifies Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS and provides several new features as well. These features can either be:
* Pre-configured, which means the AI models that the feature uses are not customizable. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications.
* Customizable, which means you'll train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically.

## Migrate from Text Analytics, QnA Maker, or Language Understanding?

Azure Cognitive Services for Language unifies three individual language services in Cognitive Services - Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and Language Understanding (LUIS). If you have been using these three services, you can easily migrate to the new Azure Cognitive Services for Language. For instructions see [Migrating to Azure Cognitive Services for Language](concepts/migrate.md).  

## Available features

Azure Cognitive Service for Language provides the following features:

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]

> | [Text Analytics for health](text-analytics-for-health/overview.md)    | This pre-configured feature extracts information from unstructured medical texts, such as clinical notes and doctor's notes.  | * [Language Studio](language-studio.md) <br> * [REST API and client-library](text-analytics-for-health/quickstart.md) <br> * [Docker container](text-analytics-for-health/how-to/use-containers.md) |
> | [Custom NER](custom-named-entity-recognition/overview.md)    | Build an AI model to extract custom entity categories, using unstructured text that you provide. |  * [Language Studio](custom-named-entity-recognition/quickstart.md?pivots=language-studio) <br> * [REST API](custom-named-entity-recognition/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api) |
> | [Analyze sentiment and opinions](sentiment-opinion-mining/overview.md)     | This pre-configured feature provides sentiment labels (such as "*negative*", "*neutral*" and "*positive*") for sentences and documents. This feature can additionally provide granular information about the opinions related to words that appear in the text, such as the attributes of products or services. |  * [Language Studio](language-studio.md) <br> * [REST API and client-library](sentiment-opinion-mining/quickstart.md) <br> * [Docker container](sentiment-opinion-mining/how-to/use-containers.md)
> |[Language detection](language-detection/overview.md)    | This pre-configured feature evaluates text, and determines the language it was written in. It returns a language identifier and a score that indicates the strength of the analysis.        | * [Language Studio](language-studio.md) <br> * [REST API and client-library](language-detection/quickstart.md) <br> * [Docker container](language-detection/how-to/use-containers.md) |

## Deploy on premises using Docker containers 
Use Language service containers to deploy API features on-premises. These Docker containers enable you to bring the service closer to your data for compliance, security, or other operational reasons. The Language service offers the following containers:

* [Sentiment analysis](sentiment-opinion-mining/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Language detection](language-detection/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Key phrase extraction](key-phrase-extraction/how-to/use-containers.md) 
* [Text Analytics for health](text-analytics-for-health/how-to/use-containers.md)


## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Read the following articles to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems:

* [Transparency note for the Language service](/legal/cognitive-services/text-analytics/transparency-note)
* [Integration and responsible use](/legal/cognitive-services/text-analytics/guidance-integration-responsible-use)
* [Data, privacy, and security](/legal/cognitive-services/text-analytics/data-privacy)
