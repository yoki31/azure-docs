# Quickstart: Detecting named entities (NER)

Use this article to get started detecting entities in text, using the NER client library and REST API. Follow these steps to try out examples code for mining text:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

[!INCLUDE [C# quickstart](includes/quickstarts/csharp-sdk.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

[!INCLUDE [Java quickstart](includes/quickstarts/java-sdk.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"

[!INCLUDE [NodeJS quickstart](includes/quickstarts/nodejs-sdk.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

[!INCLUDE [Python quickstart](includes/quickstarts/python-sdk.md)]

[!INCLUDE [REST API quickstart](includes/quickstarts/rest-api.md)]

::: zone-end

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
