# Quickstart: question answering

Get started with the custom question answering client library. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

::: zone pivot="studio"
[!INCLUDE [Studio quickstart](../includes/studio.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="rest"
[!INCLUDE [REST quickstart](../includes/rest.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
[!INCLUDE [C# client library quickstart](../includes/sdk-csharp.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
[!INCLUDE [Python client library quickstart](../includes/sdk-python.md)]
::: zone-end

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

## Explore the REST API

To learn about automating your question answering pipeline consult the REST API documentation. Currently authoring functionality is only available via REST API:

* [Authoring API reference](/rest/api/cognitiveservices/questionanswering/question-answering-projects)
* [Authoring API cURL examples](../how-to/authoring.md)
