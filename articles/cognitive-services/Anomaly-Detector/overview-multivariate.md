# What is Multivariate Anomaly Detector? (Public Preview)

The new **multivariate anomaly detection** APIs further enable developers by easily integrating advanced AI for detecting anomalies from groups of metrics, without the need for machine learning knowledge or labeled data. Dependencies and inter-correlations between up to 300 different signals are now automatically counted as key factors. This new capability helps you to proactively protect your complex systems such as software applications, servers, factory machines, spacecraft, or even your business, from failures.

Imagine 20 sensors from an auto engine generating 20 different signals like rotation, fuel pressure, bearing, etc. The readings of those signals individually may not tell you much about system level issues, but together they can represent the health of the engine. When the interaction of those signals deviates outside the usual range, the multivariate anomaly detection feature can sense the anomaly like a seasoned expert. The underlying AI models are trained and customized using your data such that it understands the unique needs of your business. With the new APIs in Anomaly Detector, developers can now easily integrate the multivariate time series anomaly detection capabilities into predictive maintenance solutions, AIOps monitoring solutions for complex enterprise software, or business intelligence tools.

## When to use **multivariate** versus **univariate**

If your goal is to detect anomalies out of a normal pattern on each individual time series purely based on their own historical data, use univariate anomaly detection APIs. For example, you want to detect daily revenue anomalies based on revenue data itself, or you want to detect a CPU spike purely based on CPU data.

If your goal is to detect system level anomalies from a group of time series data, use multivariate anomaly detection APIs. Particularly, when any individual time series won't tell you much, and you have to look at all signals (a group of time series) holistically to determine a system level issue. For example, you have an expensive physical asset like aircraft, equipment on an oil rig, or a satellite. Each of these assets has tens or hundreds of different types of sensors. You would have to look at all those time series signals from those sensors to decide whether there is system level issue.

## Sample Notebook

To learn how to call the Multivariate Anomaly Detector API, try this [Notebook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AnomalyDetector/blob/master/ipython-notebook/API%20Sample/Multivariate%20API%20Demo%20Notebook.ipynb). To run the Notebook, you only need a valid Anomaly Detector API **subscription key** and an **API endpoint**. In the notebook, add your valid Anomaly Detector API subscription key to the `subscription_key` variable, and change the `endpoint` variable to your endpoint.
 
Multivariate Anomaly Detector includes three main steps, **data preparation**, **training** and **inference**.
 
### Data preparation
For data preparation, you should prepare two parts of data, **training data** and **inference data**. As for training data, you should upload your data to Blob Storage and generate an SAS url which will be used in training API. As for inference data, you could either use the same data format as training data, or send the data into API header, which will be formatted as JSON. This depends on what API you choose to use in the inference process.
 
### Training
When training a model, you should call an asynchronous API on your training data, which means you won't get the model status immediately after calling this API, you should request another API to get the model status.
 
### Inference
In the inference process, you have two options to choose, an asynchronous API or a synchronous API. If you would like to do a batch validation, you are suggested to use the asynchronous API. If you want to do streaming in a short granularity and get the inference result immediately after each API request, you are suggested to use the synchronous API.
* As for the asynchronous API, you won't get the inference result immediately like training process, which means you should use another API to request the result after some time. Data preparation is similar with the training process.
* As for synchronized API, you could get the inference result immediately after you request, and you should send your data in a JSON format into the API body.
