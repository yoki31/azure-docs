# Get started with Custom Neural Voice

[Custom Neural Voice](https://aka.ms/customvoice) is a set of online tools that you use to create a recognizable, one-of-a-kind voice for your brand. All it takes to get started are a handful of audio files and the associated transcriptions. See if Custom Neural Voice supports your [language](language-support.md#custom-neural-voice) and [region](regions.md#custom-neural-voices).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft is committed to designing responsible AI. For that reason, we have limited the use of Custom Neural Voice. You can gain access to the technology only after your applications are reviewed and you have committed to using it in alignment with our responsible AI principles. Learn more about our [policy on the limit access](/legal/cognitive-services/speech-service/custom-neural-voice/limited-access-custom-neural-voice?context=%2fazure%2fcognitive-services%2fspeech-service%2fcontext%2fcontext), and [apply here](https://aka.ms/customneural). 
 
## Set up your Azure account

A Speech service subscription is required before you can use Custom Neural Voice. Follow these instructions to create a Speech service subscription in Azure. If you don't have an Azure account, you can sign up for a new one.  

Once you've created an Azure account and a Speech service subscription, you'll need to sign in to Speech Studio and connect your subscription.

1. Get your Speech service subscription key from the Azure portal.
1. Sign in to [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com), and then select **Custom Voice**.
1. Select your subscription and create a speech project.
1. If you want to switch to another Speech subscription, select the **cog** icon at the top.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have an F0 or S0 Speech service key created in Azure before you can use the service. Custom Neural Voice only supports the S0 tier. 

## Create a project

Content like data, models, tests, and endpoints are organized into projects in Speech Studio. Each project is specific to a country and language, and the gender of the voice you want to create. For example, you might create a project for a female voice for your call center's chat bots that use English in the United States.

To create a custom voice project:

1. Sign in to [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Text-to-Speech** > **Custom Voice** > **Create project**. 
1. Follow the instructions provided by the wizard to create your project. 
1. After you've created a project, you see four tabs: **Set up voice talent**, **Prepare training data**, **Train model**, and **Deploy model**. See [Prepare data for Custom Neural Voice](how-to-custom-voice-prepare-data.md) to set up the voice talent, and proceed to training data.

## Tips for creating a custom neural voice

Creating a great custom neural voice requires careful quality control in each step, from voice design and data preparation, to the deployment of the voice model to your system. The following sections discuss some key steps to take when you're creating a custom neural voice for your organization. 

### Persona design

First, design a persona of the voice that represents your brand by using a persona brief document. This document defines elements such as the features of the voice, and the character behind the voice. This helps to guide the process of creating a custom neural voice model, including defining the scripts, selecting your voice talent, training, and voice tuning.

### Script selection
 
Carefully select the recording script to represent the user scenarios for your voice. For example, you can use the phrases from bot conversations as your recording script if you are creating a customer service bot. Include different sentence types in your scripts, including statements, questions, and exclamations.

### Preparing training data

It's a good idea to capture the audio recordings in a professional quality recording studio to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. The quality of the voice model depends heavily on your training data. Consistent volume, speaking rate, pitch, and consistency in expressive mannerisms of speech are required.

After the recordings are ready, follow [Prepare training data](how-to-custom-voice-prepare-data.md) to prepare the training data in the right format.

### Training

After you have prepared the training data, go to [Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/custom-voice) to create your custom neural voice. Select at least 300 utterances to create a custom neural voice. A series of data quality checks are automatically performed when you upload them. To build high-quality voice models, you should fix any errors and submit again.

### Testing

Prepare test scripts for your voice model that cover the different use cases for your apps. Itâ€™s a good idea to use scripts within and outside the training dataset, so you can test the quality more broadly for different content.

### Tuning and adjustment

The style and the characteristics of the trained voice model depend on the style and the quality of the recordings from the voice talent used for training. However, you can make several adjustments by using [SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)](./speech-synthesis-markup.md?tabs=csharp) when you make the API calls to your voice model to generate synthetic speech.

SSML is the markup language used to communicate with the text-to-speech service to convert text into audio. The adjustments you can make include change of pitch, rate, intonation, and pronunciation correction. If the voice model is built with multiple styles, you can also use SSML to switch the styles.

## Migrate to Custom Neural Voice

If you're using the old version of Custom Voice (which is scheduled to be retired in February 2024), see [How to migrate to Custom Neural Voice](how-to-migrate-to-custom-neural-voice.md).
