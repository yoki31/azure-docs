> [Voices in preview](../language-support.md#prebuilt-neural-voices-in-preview) are available in only these three regions: East US, West Europe, and Southeast Asia.

### Custom neural voices

If you've created a custom neural voice font, use the endpoint that you've created. You can also use the following endpoints. Replace `{deploymentId}` with the deployment ID for your neural voice model.

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Australia East | `https://australiaeast.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Brazil South | `https://brazilsouth.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Canada Central | `https://canadacentral.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Central US | `https://centralus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding regions are available for neural voice model hosting and real-time synthesis. Custom neural voice training is available in only these three regions: East US, Southeast Asia, and UK South. But users can easily copy a neural voice model from the three regions to other regions in the preceding list.

### Long Audio API

The Long Audio API is available in multiple regions with unique endpoints:

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Australia East | `https://australiaeast.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| East US | `https://eastus.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| India Central | `https://centralindia.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| South Central US | `https://southcentralus.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| Southeast Asia | `https://southeastasia.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| UK South | `https://uksouth.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| West Europe | `https://westeurope.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
