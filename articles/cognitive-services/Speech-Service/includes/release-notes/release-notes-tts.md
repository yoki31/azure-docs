Read the [full announcement of the TTS updates for Ignite 2020](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/ignite-2020-neural-tts-updates-new-language-support-more-voices/ba-p/1698544)

### 2020-August release

#### New features

* **Neural text-to-speech: new speaking style for `en-US` Aria voice**. AriaNeural can sound like a news caster when reading news. The 'newscast-formal' style sounds more serious, while the 'newscast-casual' style is more relaxed and informal. See [how to use the speaking styles in SSML](../../speech-synthesis-markup.md).

* **Custom Voice: a new feature is released to automatically check training data quality**. When you upload your data, the system will examine various aspects of your audio and transcript data, and automatically fix or filter issues to improve the quality of the voice model. This covers the volume of your audio, the noise level, the pronunciation accuracy of speech, the alignment of speech with the normalized text, silence in the audio, in addition to the audio and script format.

* **Audio Content Creation: a set of new features to enable more powerful voice tuning and audio management capabilities**.

    * Pronunciation:  the pronunciation tuning feature is updated to the latest phoneme set. You can pick the right phoneme element from the library and refine the pronunciation of the words you have selected.

    * Download: The audio "Download"/"Export" feature is enhanced to support generating audio by paragraph. You can edit content in the same file/SSML, while generating multiple audio outputs. The file structure of "Download" is refined as well. Now, you can easily get all audio files in one folder.

    * Task status : The multi-file export experience is improved. When you export multiple files in the past, if one of the files has failed, the entire task will fail. But now, all other files will be successfully exported. The task report is enriched with more detailed and structured information. You can check the logs for all failed files and sentences now with the report.

    * SSML documentation: linked to SSML document to help you check the rules for how to use all tuning features.
