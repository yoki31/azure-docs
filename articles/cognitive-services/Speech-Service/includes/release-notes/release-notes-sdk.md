### Speech SDK 1.20.0: January 2022 release


#### New features

- **Objective-C, Swift, and Python**: Added support for DialogServiceConnector, used for [Voice-Assistant scenarios](../../voice-assistants.md).
- **Python**: Support for Python 3.10 was added. Support for Python 3.6 was removed, per Python's [end-of-life for 3.6](https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches).
- **Unity**: Speech SDK is now supported for Unity applications on Linux.
- **C++, C#**: IntentRecognizer using pattern matching is now supported in C#. In addition, scenarios with custom entities, optional groups, and entity roles are now supported in C++ and C#.
- **C++, C#**: Improved diagnostics trace logging using new classes FileLogger, MemoryLogger, and EventLogger. SDK logs are an important tool for Microsoft to diagnose customer-reported issues. These new classes make it easier for customers to integrate Speech SDK logs into their own logging system.
- **All programming languages**: PronunciationAssessmentConfig now has properties to set the desired phoneme alphabet (IPA or SAPI) and N-Best Phoneme Count (avoiding the need to author a configuration JSON as per [GitHub issue 1284](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1284)). Also, syllable level output is now supported.
- **Android, iOS and MacOS (all programming languages)**: GStreamer is no longer needed to support limited-bandwidth networks. SpeechSynthesizer now uses the operating system's audio decoding capabilities to decode compressed audio streamed from the text-to-speech service.
- **All programming languages**: SpeechSynthesizer now supports three new raw output Opus formats (without container), which are widely used in live streaming scenarios.
- **JavaScript**: Added getVoicesAsync() API to SpeechSynthesizer to retrieve the list of supported synthesis voices ([GitHub issue 1350](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1350))
- **JavaScript**: Added getWaveFormat() API to AudioStreamFormat to support non-PCM wave formats ([GitHub issue 452](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/452))
- **JavaScript**: Added volume getter/setter and mute()/unmute() APIs to SpeakerAudioDestination ([GitHub issue 463](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/463))

#### Bug fixes
- **C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, and Swift**: Fix to remove a 10-second delay while stopping a speech recognizer that uses a PushAudioInputStream. This is for the case where no new audio is pushed in after StopContinuousRecognition is called (GitHub issues [1318](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1388), [331](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/331))
- **Unity on Android and UWP**: Unity meta files were fixed for UWP, Android ARM64, and Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) ARM64 ([GitHub issue 1360](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1360))
- **iOS**: Compiling your Speech SDK application on any iOS Device when using CocoaPods is now fixed ([GitHub issue 1320](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1320))
- **iOS**: When SpeechSynthesizer is configured to output audio directly to a speaker, playback stopped at the beginning in rare conditions. This was fixed.
- **JavaScript**: Use script processor fallback for microphone input if no audio worklet is found ([GitHub issue 455](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/455))
- **JavaScript**: Add protocol to agent to mitigate bug found with Sentry integration ([GitHub issue 465](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/465))

### Speech SDK 1.17.0: 2021-May release

>[!NOTE]
>Get started with the Speech SDK [here](../../speech-sdk.md#get-the-speech-sdk).

#### Highlights summary

- Smaller footprint - we continue to decrease the memory and disk footprint of the Speech SDK and its components.
- A new stand-alone Language Identification API allows you to recognize what language is being spoken.
- Develop speech enabled mixed reality and gaming applications using Unity on macOS.
- You can now use Text-to-Speech in addition to speech recognition from the Go programming language.
- Several Bug fixes to address issues YOU, our valued customers, have flagged on GitHub! THANK YOU! Keep the feedback coming!

#### New features

- **C++/C#**: New stand-alone Single-Shot/At-Start and Continuous Language Detection via the `SourceLanguageRecognizer` API. If you only want to detect the language(s) spoken in audio content, this is the API to do that. See details for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/sourcelanguagerecognizer) and [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.sourcelanguagerecognizer).
- **C++/C#**: Speech Recognition and Translation Recognition now support both at-start and continuous Language Identification so you can programmatically determine which language(s) are being spoken before they are transcribed or translated. See documentation [here for Speech Recognition](../../how-to-automatic-language-detection.md) and [here for Speech Translation](../../get-started-speech-translation.md).
- **C#**:  Added support Unity support to macOS (x64). This unlocks speech recognition and speech synthesis use cases in mixed reality and gaming!
- **Go**: We added support for speech synthesis/Text-to-Speech to the Go programming language to make speech synthesis available in even more use cases. See our [quickstart](../../get-started-text-to-speech.md?tabs=windowsinstall&pivots=programming-language-go) or our [reference documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go).
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: The speech synthesizer now supports the `connection` object. This helps you manage and monitor the connection to the Speech service, and is especially helpful to pre-connect to reduce latency. See documentation [here](../../how-to-lower-speech-synthesis-latency.md).
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: We now expose the latency and underrun time in `SpeechSynthesisResult` to help you monitor and diagnose speech synthesis latency issues. See details for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechsynthesisresult), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisresult), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisresult), [Python](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisresult), [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechsynthesisresult) and [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go#readme-reference).
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C**: Text-to-Speech [now uses neural voices](../../text-to-speech.md#core-features) by default when you don't specify a voice to be used. This gives you higher fidelity output by default, but also [increases the default price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/#pricing). You can specify any of our [over 70 standard voices](../../how-to-migrate-to-prebuilt-neural-voice.md) or [over 130 neural voices](../../language-support.md#prebuilt-neural-voices) to change the default.
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: We added a Gender property to the synthesis voice info to make it easier to select voices based on gender. This addresses [GitHub issue #1055](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1055).
- **C++, C#, Java, JavaScript**: We now support `retrieveEnrollmentResultAsync`, `getAuthorizationPhrasesAsync`, and `getAllProfilesAsync()` in Speaker Recognition to ease user management of all voice profiles for a given account. See documentation for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speaker-voiceprofileclient), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speaker.voiceprofileclient), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.voiceprofileclient), [JavaScript](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/voiceprofileclient). This addresses [GitHub issue #338](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/338).
- **JavaScript**: We added retry for connection failures that will make your JavaScript based speech applications more robust.

#### Improvements

- Linux and Android Speech SDK binaries have been updated to use the latest version of OpenSSL (1.1.1k)
- Code Size improvements:
    - Language Understanding is now split into a separate "lu" library.
    - Windows x64 core binary size decreased by 14.4%.
    - Android ARM64 core binary size decreased by 13.7%.
    - other components also decreased in size.

#### Bug fixes

- **All**: Fixed [GitHub issue #842](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/842) for ServiceTimeout. You can now transcribe very long audio files using the Speech SDK without the connection to the service terminating with this error. However, we still recommend you use [batch transcription](../../batch-transcription.md) for long files.
- **C#**: Fixed [GitHub issue #947](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/947) where no speech input could leave your app in a bad state.
- **Java**: Fixed [GitHub Issue #997](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/997) where the Java Speech SDK 1.16 crashes when using DialogServiceConnector without a network connection or an invalid subscription key.
- Fixed a crash when abruptly stopping speech recognition (for example, using CTRL+C on console app).
- **Java**: Added a fix to delete temporary files on Windows when using Java Speech SDK.
- **Java**: Fixed [GitHub issue #994](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/994) where calling `DialogServiceConnector.stopListeningAsync` could result in an error.
- **Java**: Fixed a customer issue in the [virtual assistant quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/java/jre/virtual-assistant).
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #366](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/366) where `ConversationTranslator` threw an error 'this.cancelSpeech is not a function'.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #298](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/298) where 'Get result as an in-memory stream' sample played sound out loud.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #350](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/350) where calling `AudioConfig` could result in a 'ReferenceError: MediaStream is not defined'.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed an UnhandledPromiseRejection warning in Node.js for long-running sessions.

#### Samples

- Updated Unity samples documentation for macOS [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk).
- A React Native sample for the Cognitive Services speech recognition service is now available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-sdk-react-native-example).


### Speech SDK 1.16.0: 2021-March release

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK on Windows depends on the shared Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019. Download it [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

#### New features

- **C++/C#/Java/Python**: Moved to the latest version of GStreamer (1.18.3) to add support for transcribing any media format on Windows, Linux, and Android. See documentation [here](../../how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Added support for decoding compressed TTS/synthesized audio to the SDK. If you set output audio format to PCM and GStreamer is available on your system, the SDK will automatically request compressed audio from the service to save bandwidth and decode the audio on the client. You can set `SpeechServiceConnection_SynthEnableCompressedAudioTransmission` to `false` to disable this feature. Details for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-namespace#propertyid), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.propertyid), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.propertyid), [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxpropertyid), [Python](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.propertyid).
- **JavaScript**: Node.js users can now use the [`AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput` API](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/audioconfig#fromWavFileInput_File_). This addresses [GitHub issue #252](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/252).
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Added `GetVoicesAsync()` method for TTS to return all available synthesis voices. Details for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechsynthesizer#getvoicesasync), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesizer#methods), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesizer#methods), [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechsynthesizer#getvoiceasync), and [Python](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesizer#methods).
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Python**: Added `VisemeReceived` event for TTS/speech synthesis to return synchronous viseme animation. See documentation [here](../../how-to-speech-synthesis-viseme.md).
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Python**: Added `BookmarkReached` event for TTS. You can set bookmarks in the input SSML and get the audio offsets for each bookmark. See documentation [here](../../speech-synthesis-markup.md#bookmark-element).
- **Java**: Added support for Speaker Recognition APIs. Details [here](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speakerrecognizer).
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Python**: Added two new output audio formats with WebM container for TTS (Webm16Khz16BitMonoOpus and Webm24Khz16BitMonoOpus). These are better formats for streaming audio with the Opus codec. Details for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-namespace#speechsynthesisoutputformat), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisoutputformat), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisoutputformat), [JavaScript](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechsynthesisoutputformat), [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechsynthesisoutputformat), [Python](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisoutputformat).
- **C++/C#/Java**: Added support for retrieving voice profile for Speaker Recognition scenario. Details for [C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speaker-speakerrecognizer), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speaker.speakerrecognizer), and [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speakerrecognizer).
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Added support for separate shared library for audio microphone and speaker control. This allows the developer to use the SDK in environments that do not have required audio library dependencies.
- **Objective-C/Swift**: Added support for module framework with umbrella header. This allows the developer to import Speech SDK as a module in iOS/Mac Objective-C/Swift apps. This addresses [GitHub issue #452](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/452).
- **Python**: Added support for [Python 3.9](../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-python) and dropped support for Python 3.5 per Python's [end-of-life for 3.5](https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches).

**Known issues**

- **C++/C#/Java**: `DialogServiceConnector` cannot use a `CustomCommandsConfig` to access a Custom Commands application and will instead encounter a connection error. This can be worked around by manually adding your application ID to the request with `config.SetServiceProperty("X-CommandsAppId", "your-application-id", ServicePropertyChannel.UriQueryParameter)`. The expected behavior of `CustomCommandsConfig` will be restored in the next release.

#### Improvements

- As part of our multi-release effort to reduce the Speech SDK's memory usage and disk footprint, Android binaries are now 3% to 5% smaller.
- Improved accuracy, readability, and see-also sections of our C# reference documentation [here](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech).

#### Bug fixes

- **JavaScript**: Large WAV file headers are now parsed correctly (increases header slice to 512 bytes). This addresses [GitHub issue #962](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/962).
- **JavaScript**: Corrected microphone timing issue if mic stream ends before stop recognition, addressing an issue with Speech Recognition not working in Firefox.
- **JavaScript**: We now correctly handle initialization promise when the browser forces mic off before turnOn completes.
- **JavaScript**: We replaced URL dependency with url-parse. This addresses [GitHub issue #264](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/264).
- **Android**: Fixed callbacks not working when `minifyEnabled` is set to true.
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: `TCP_NODELAY` will be correctly set to underlying socket IO for TTS to reduce latency.
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: Fixed an occasional crash when the recognizer was destroyed just after starting a recognition.
- **C++/C#/Java**: Fixed an occasional crash in the destruction of speaker recognizer.

#### Samples

- **JavaScript**: [Browser samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/js/browser) no longer require separate JavaScript library file download.


### Speech SDK 1.15.0: 2021-January release

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK on Windows depends on the shared Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019. Download it [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

#### Highlights summary
- Smaller memory and disk footprint making the SDK more efficient.
- Higher fidelity output formats available for custom-neural voice private preview.
- Intent Recognizer can now get return more than the top intent, giving you the ability to make a separate assessment about your customer's intent.
- Your voice assistant or bot are now easier to set up, and you can make it stop listening immediately, and exercise greater control over how it responds to errors.
- Improved on device performance through making compression optional.
- Use the Speech SDK on Windows ARM/ARM64.
- Improved low-level debugging.
- Pronunciation Assessment feature is now more widely available.
- Several Bug fixes to address issues YOU, our valued customers, have flagged on GitHub! THANK YOU! Keep the feedback coming!

#### Improvements
- The Speech SDK is now more efficient and lightweight. We've started a multi-release effort to reduce the Speech SDK's memory usage and disk footprint. As a first step we made significant file size reductions in shared libraries on most platforms. Compared to the 1.14 release:
  - 64-bit UWP-compatible Windows libraries are about 30% smaller.
  - 32-bit Windows libraries are not yet seeing a size improvements.
  - Linux libraries are 20-25% smaller.
  - Android libraries are 3-5% smaller.

#### New features
- **All**: New 48KHz output formats available for the private preview of custom-neural voice through the TTS speech synthesis API: Audio48Khz192KBitRateMonoMp3, audio-48khz-192kbitrate-mono-mp3, Audio48Khz96KBitRateMonoMp3, audio-48khz-96kbitrate-mono-mp3, Raw48Khz16BitMonoPcm, raw-48khz-16bit-mono-pcm, Riff48Khz16BitMonoPcm, riff-48khz-16bit-mono-pcm.
- **All**: Custom voice is also easier to use. Added support for setting custom voice via `EndpointId` ([C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechconfig#setendpointid), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.endpointid#Microsoft_CognitiveServices_Speech_SpeechConfig_EndpointId), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.setendpointid#com_microsoft_cognitiveservices_speech_SpeechConfig_setEndpointId_String_), [JavaScript](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechconfig#endpointId), [Objective-C](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechconfiguration#endpointid), [Python](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig#endpoint-id)). Before this change, custom voice users needed to set the endpoint URL via the `FromEndpoint` method. Now customers can use the `FromSubscription` method just like prebuilt voices, and then provide the deployment ID by setting `EndpointId`. This simplifies setting up custom voices.
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Get more than the top intent from`IntentRecognizer`. It now supports configuring the JSON result containing all intents and not only the top scoring intent via `LanguageUnderstandingModel FromEndpoint` method by using `verbose=true` uri parameter. This addresses [GitHub issue #880](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/880). See updated documentation [here](../../get-started-intent-recognition.md#add-a-languageunderstandingmodel-and-intents).
- **C++/C#/Java**: Make your voice assistant or bot stop listening immediately. `DialogServiceConnector` ([C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/dialog-dialogserviceconnector), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector)) now has a `StopListeningAsync()` method to accompany `ListenOnceAsync()`. This will immediately stop audio capture and gracefully wait for a result, making it perfect for use with "stop now" button-press scenarios.
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript**: Make your voice assistant or bot react better to underlying system errors. `DialogServiceConnector` ([C++](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/dialog-dialogserviceconnector), [C#](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector), [Java](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector), [JavaScript](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/dialogserviceconnector)) now has a new `TurnStatusReceived` event handler. These optional events correspond to every [`ITurnContext`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.bot.builder.iturncontext) resolution on the Bot and will report turn execution failures when they happen, for example, as a result of an unhandled exception, timeout, or network drop between Direct Line Speech and the bot. `TurnStatusReceived` makes it easier to respond to failure conditions. For example, if a bot takes too long on a backend database query (for example, looking up a product), `TurnStatusReceived` allows the client to know to reprompt with "sorry, I didn't quite get that, could you please try again" or something similar.
- **C++/C#**: Use the Speech SDK on more platforms. The [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) now supports Windows ARM/ARM64 desktop native binaries (UWP was already supported) to make the Speech SDK more useful on more machine types.
- **Java**: [`DialogServiceConnector`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector) now has a `setSpeechActivityTemplate()` method that was unintentionally excluded from the language previously. This is equivalent to setting the `Conversation_Speech_Activity_Template` property and will request that all future Bot Framework activities originated by the Direct Line Speech service merge the provided content into their JSON payloads.
- **Java**: Improved low-level debugging. The [`Connection`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.connection) class now has a `MessageReceived` event, similar to other programming languages (C++, C#). This event provides low-level access to incoming data from the service and can be useful for diagnostics and debugging.
- **JavaScript**: Easier setup for Voice Assistants and bots through [`BotFrameworkConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/botframeworkconfig), which now has `fromHost()` and `fromEndpoint()` factory methods that simplify the use of custom service locations versus manually setting properties. We also standardized optional specification of `botId` to use a non-default bot across the configuration factories.
- **JavaScript**: Improved on device performance through added string control property for websocket compression. For performance reasons, we disabled websocket compression by default. This can be reenabled for low-bandwidth scenarios. More details [here](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/propertyid). This addresses [GitHub issue #242](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/242).
- **JavaScript**: Added support for lPronunciation Assessment to enable evaluation of speech pronunciation. See the quickstart [here](../../how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

#### Bug fixes
- **All** (except JavaScript): Fixed a regression in version 1.14, in which too much memory was allocated by the recognizer.
- **C++**: Fixed a garbage collection issue with `DialogServiceConnector`, addressing [GitHub issue #794](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/794).
- **C#**: Fixed an issue with thread shutdown that caused objects to block for about a second when disposed.
- **C++/C#/Java**: Fixed an exception preventing an application from setting speech authorization token or activity template more than once on a `DialogServiceConnector`.
- **C++/C#/Java**: Fixed a recognizer crash due to a race condition in teardown.
- **JavaScript**: [`DialogServiceConnector`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/dialogserviceconnector) didn't previously honor the optional `botId` parameter specified in `BotFrameworkConfig`'s factories. This made it necessary to set the `botId` query string parameter manually to use a non-default bot. The bug has been corrected and `botId` values provided to `BotFrameworkConfig`'s factories will be honored and used, including the new `fromHost()` and `fromEndpoint()` additions. This also applies to the `applicationId` parameter for `CustomCommandsConfig`.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #881](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/881), allowing recognizer object reusage.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed an issue where the SKD was sending `speech.config` multiple times in one TTS session, wasting bandwidth.
- **JavaScript**: Simplified error handling on microphone authorization, allowing more descriptive message to bubble up when user has not allowed microphone input on their browser.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #249](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/249) where type errors in `ConversationTranslator` and `ConversationTranscriber` caused a compilation error for TypeScript users.
- **Objective-C**: Fixed an issue where GStreamer build failed for iOS on Xcode 11.4, addressing [GitHub issue #911](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/911).
- **Python**: Fixed [GitHub issue #870](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/870), removing "DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favor of importlib".

#### Samples
- [From-file sample for JavaScript browser](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/quickstart/javascript/browser/from-file/index.html) now uses files for speech recognition. This addresses [GitHub issue #884](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/884).

### Speech SDK 1.10.0: 2020-February release

#### New features

 - Added Python packages to support the new 3.8 release of Python.
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS 8 x64 support (C++, C#, Java, Python).
   > [!NOTE]
   > Customers must configure OpenSSL according to [these instructions](../../how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).
 - Linux ARM32 support for Debian and Ubuntu.
 - DialogServiceConnector now supports an optional "bot ID" parameter on BotFrameworkConfig. This parameter allows the use of multiple Direct Line Speech bots with a single Azure speech resource. Without the parameter specified, the default bot (as determined by the Direct Line Speech channel configuration page) will be used.
 - DialogServiceConnector now has a SpeechActivityTemplate property. The contents of this JSON string will be used by Direct Line Speech to pre-populate a wide variety of supported fields in all activities that reach a Direct Line Speech bot, including activities automatically generated in response to events like speech recognition.
 - TTS now uses subscription key for authentication, reducing the first byte latency of the first synthesis result after creating a synthesizer.
 - Updated speech recognition models for 19 locales for an average word error rate reduction of 18.6% (es-ES, es-MX, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, zh-CN, zh-HK, nb-NO, fi-FL, ru-RU, pl-PL, ca-ES, zh-TW, th-TH, pt-PT, tr-TR). The new models bring significant improvements across multiple domains including Dictation, Call-Center Transcription, and Video Indexing scenarios.

#### Bug fixes

 - Fixed bug where Conversation Transcriber didn't await  properly in JAVA APIs
 - Android x86 emulator fix for Xamarin [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/363)
 - Add missing (Get|Set)Property methods to AudioConfig
 - Fix a TTS bug where the audioDataStream couldn't be stopped when connection fails
 - Using an endpoint without a region would cause USP failures for conversation translator
 - ID generation in Universal Windows Applications now uses an appropriately unique GUID algorithm; it previously and unintentionally defaulted to a stubbed implementation that often produced collisions over large sets of interactions.

 #### Samples

 - Unity sample for using Speech SDK with [Unity microphone and push mode streaming](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/unity/from-unitymicrophone)

**Other changes**

 - [OpenSSL configuration documentation updated for Linux](../../how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md)

### Speech SDK 1.9.0: 2020-January release

#### New features

- Multi-device conversation: connect multiple devices to the same speech or text-based conversation, and optionally translate messages sent between them. Learn more in [this article](../../multi-device-conversation.md).
- Keyword recognition support added for Android `.aar` package and added support for x86 and x64 flavors.
- Objective-C: `SendMessage` and `SetMessageProperty` methods added to `Connection` object. See documentation [here](/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxconnection).
- TTS C++ api now supports `std::wstring` as synthesis text input, removing the need to convert a wstring to string before passing it to the SDK. See details [here](/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechsynthesizer#speaktextasync).
- C#: [Language ID](../../how-to-automatic-language-detection.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and [source language config](../../how-to-specify-source-language.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) are now available.
- JavaScript: Added a feature to `Connection` object to pass through custom messages from the Speech service as callback `receivedServiceMessage`.
- JavaScript: Added support for `FromHost API` to ease use with on-prem containers and sovereign clouds. See documentation [here](../../speech-container-howto.md).
- JavaScript: We now honor `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` thanks to a contribution from [orgads](https://github.com/orgads). See details [here](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/pull/75).

**Breaking changes**

- `OpenSSL` has been updated to version 1.1.1b and is statically linked to the Speech SDK core library for Linux. This may cause a break if your inbox `OpenSSL` has not been installed to the `/usr/lib/ssl` directory in the system. Please check [our documentation](../../how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md) under Speech SDK docs to work around the issue.
- We've changed the data type returned for C# `WordLevelTimingResult.Offset` from `int` to `long` to allow for access to `WordLevelTimingResults` when speech data is longer than 2 minutes.
- `PushAudioInputStream` and `PullAudioInputStream` now send wav header information to the Speech service based on `AudioStreamFormat`, optionally specified when they were created. Customers must now use the [supported audio input format](../../how-to-use-audio-input-streams.md). Any other formats will get suboptimal recognition results or may cause other issues.

#### Bug fixes

- See the `OpenSSL` update under Breaking changes above. We fixed both an intermittent crash and a performance issue (lock contention under high load) in Linux and Java.
- Java: Made improvements to object closure in high concurrency scenarios.
- Restructured our NuGet package. We removed the three copies of `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.dll` and `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.extension.kws.dll` under lib folders, making the NuGet package smaller and faster to download, and we added headers needed to compile some C++ native apps.

- Support AuthorizationToken for creating factory instances.

**Breaking changes**

- Recognition events: `NoMatch` event type was merged into the `Error` event.
- SpeechOutputFormat in C# was renamed to `OutputFormat` to stay aligned with C++.
- The return type of some methods of the `AudioInputStream` interface changed slightly:
  - In Java, the `read` method now returns `long` instead of `int`.
  - In C#, the `Read` method now returns `uint` instead of `int`.
  - In C++, the `Read` and `GetFormat` methods now return `size_t` instead of `int`.
- C++: Instances of audio input streams now can be passed only as a `shared_ptr`.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed incorrect return values in the result when `RecognizeAsync()` times out.
- The dependency on media foundation libraries on Windows was removed. The SDK now uses Core Audio APIs.
- Documentation fix: Added a [regions](../../regions.md) page to describe the supported regions.

#### Breaking change

- Changed to `SpeechRecognitionResult.Text` from `SpeechRecognitionResult.RecognizedText` in C#.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a possible callback issue in the USP layer during shutdown.
- If a recognizer consumed an audio input file, it was holding on to the file handle longer than necessary.
- Removed several deadlocks between the message pump and the recognizer.
- Fire a `NoMatch` result when the response from service is timed out.
- The media foundation libraries on Windows are delay loaded. This library is required for microphone input only.
