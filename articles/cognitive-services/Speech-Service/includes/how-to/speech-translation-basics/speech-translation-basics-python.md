One of the core features of the Speech service is the ability to recognize human speech and translate it to other languages. In this quickstart, you learn how to use the Speech SDK in your apps and products to perform high-quality speech translation. This quickstart covers these topics:

* Translating speech to text
* Translating speech to multiple target languages
* Performing direct speech-to-speech translation

## Skip to samples on GitHub

If you want to skip straight to sample code, see the [Python quickstart samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/python) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and a Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and a subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

### Install the Speech SDK

[!INCLUDE [Get the Speech SDK include](../../get-speech-sdk-python.md)]

### Import dependencies

To run the examples in this article, include the following `import` statements at the top of the Python code file:

```python
import os
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk
```

## Sensitive data and environment variables

The example source code in this article depends on environment variables for storing sensitive data, such as the Speech resource's subscription key and region. The Python code file contains two values that are assigned from the host machine's environment variables: `SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY` and `SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION`. Both of these variables are at the global scope, so they're accessible within the function definition of the code file: 

```python
speech_key, service_region = os.environ['SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY'], os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION']
```

For more information on environment variables, see [Environment variables and application configuration](../../../../cognitive-services-security.md#environment-variables-and-application-configuration).

## Create a speech translation configuration

To call the Speech service by using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config] instance. This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token.

> [!TIP]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

You can initialize `SpeechTranslationConfig` in a few ways:

* With a subscription: pass in a key and the associated region.
* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

Let's look at how you can create a `SpeechTranslationConfig` instance by using a key and region. Get these credentials by following the steps in [Try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

```python
from_language, to_language = 'en-US', 'de'

def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)
```

## Change the source language

One common task of speech translation is specifying the input (or source) language. The following example shows how you would change the input language to Italian. In your code, interact with the `SpeechTranslationConfig` instance by assigning it to the [`speech_recognition_language`][recognitionlang] property.

```python
def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    # Source (input) language
    from_language = "it-IT"
    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
```

The `speech_recognition_language` property expects a language-locale format string. You can provide any value in the **Locale** column in the [list of supported locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).

## Add a translation language

Another common task of speech translation is to specify target translation languages. At least one is required, but multiples are supported. The following code snippet sets both French and German as translation language targets:

```python
def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = "it-IT"

    # Translate to languages. See, https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
    translation_config.add_target_language("fr")
    translation_config.add_target_language("de")
```

With every call to [`add_target_language`][addlang], a new target translation language is specified. In other words, when speech is recognized from the source language, each target translation is available as part of the resulting translation operation.

## Initialize a translation recognizer

After you've created a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config] instance, the next step is to initialize [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer]. When you initialize `TranslationRecognizer`, you need to pass it your `translation_config` instance. The configuration object provides the credentials that the Speech service requires to validate your request.

If you're recognizing speech by using your device's default microphone, here's what `TranslationRecognizer` should look like:

```python
def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
    translation_config.add_target_language(to_language)

    recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(
            translation_config=translation_config)
```

If you want to specify the audio input device, then you need to create an [`AudioConfig`][audioconfig] class instance and provide the `audio_config` parameter when initializing `TranslationRecognizer`.

> [!TIP]
> [Learn how to get the device ID for your audio input device](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md).

First, reference the `AudioConfig` object as follows:

```python
def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
    for lang in to_languages:
        translation_config.add_target_language(lang)

    audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(use_default_microphone=True)
    recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(
            translation_config=translation_config, audio_config=audio_config)
```

If you want to provide an audio file instead of using a microphone, you still need to provide an `audioConfig` parameter. However, when you create an `AudioConfig` class instance, instead of calling with `use_default_microphone=True`, you call with `filename="path-to-file.wav"` and provide the `filename` parameter:

```python
def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
    for lang in to_languages:
        translation_config.add_target_language(lang)

    audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(filename="path-to-file.wav")
    recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(
            translation_config=translation_config, audio_config=audio_config)
```

## Translate speech

To translate speech, the Speech SDK relies on a microphone or an audio file input. Speech recognition occurs before speech translation. After all objects have been initialized, call the recognize-once function and get the result:

```python
import os
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

speech_key, service_region = os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__KEY'], os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION']
from_language, to_languages = 'en-US', 'de'

def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
    translation_config.add_target_language(to_language)

    recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(
            translation_config=translation_config)
    
    print('Say something...')
    result = recognizer.recognize_once()
    print(get_result_text(reason=result.reason, result=result))

def get_result_text(reason, result):
    reason_format = {
        speechsdk.ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech:
            f'RECOGNIZED "{from_language}": {result.text}\n' +
            f'TRANSLATED into "{to_language}"": {result.translations[to_language]}',
        speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech: f'Recognized: "{result.text}"',
        speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch: f'No speech could be recognized: {result.no_match_details}',
        speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled: f'Speech Recognition canceled: {result.cancellation_details}'
    }
    return reason_format.get(reason, 'Unable to recognize speech')

translate_speech_to_text()
```

For more information about speech-to-text, see [the basics of speech recognition](../../../get-started-speech-to-text.md).

## Synthesize translations

After a successful speech recognition and translation, the result contains all the translations in a dictionary. The [`translations`][translations] dictionary key is the target translation language, and the value is the translated text. Recognized speech can be translated and then synthesized in a different language (speech-to-speech).

### Event-based synthesis

The `TranslationRecognizer` object exposes a `Synthesizing` event. The event fires several times and provides a mechanism to retrieve the synthesized audio from the translation recognition result. If you're translating to multiple languages, see [Manual synthesis](#manual-synthesis). 

Specify the synthesis voice by assigning a [`voice_name`][voicename] instance, and provide an event handler for the `Synthesizing` event to get the audio. The following example saves the translated audio as a .wav file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The event-based synthesis works only with a single translation. *Do not* add multiple target translation languages. Additionally, the [`voice_name`][voicename] value should be the same language as the target translation language. For example, `"de"` could map to `"de-DE-Hedda"`.

```python
import os
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

speech_key, service_region = os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__KEY'], os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION']
from_language, to_language = 'en-US', 'de'

def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
    translation_config.add_target_language(to_language)

    # See: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion#standard-and-neural-voices
    translation_config.voice_name = "de-DE-Hedda"

    recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(
            translation_config=translation_config)

    def synthesis_callback(evt):
        size = len(evt.result.audio)
        print(f'Audio synthesized: {size} byte(s) {"(COMPLETED)" if size == 0 else ""}')

        if size > 0:
            file = open('translation.wav', 'wb+')
            file.write(evt.result.audio)
            file.close()

    recognizer.synthesizing.connect(synthesis_callback)

    print(f'Say something in "{from_language}" and we\'ll translate into "{to_language}".')

    result = recognizer.recognize_once()
    print(get_result_text(reason=result.reason, result=result))

def get_result_text(reason, result):
    reason_format = {
        speechsdk.ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech:
            f'Recognized "{from_language}": {result.text}\n' +
            f'Translated into "{to_language}"": {result.translations[to_language]}',
        speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech: f'Recognized: "{result.text}"',
        speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch: f'No speech could be recognized: {result.no_match_details}',
        speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled: f'Speech Recognition canceled: {result.cancellation_details}'
    }
    return reason_format.get(reason, 'Unable to recognize speech')

translate_speech_to_text()
```

### Manual synthesis

You can use the [`translations`][translations] dictionary to synthesize audio from the translation text. Iterate through each translation and synthesize it. When you're creating a `SpeechSynthesizer` instance, the `SpeechConfig` object needs to have its [`speech_synthesis_voice_name`][speechsynthesisvoicename] property set to the desired voice. 

The following example translates to five languages. Each translation is then synthesized to an audio file in the corresponding neural language.

```python
import os
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

speech_key, service_region = os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__KEY'], os.environ['SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION']
from_language, to_languages = 'en-US', [ 'de', 'en', 'it', 'pt', 'zh-Hans' ]

def translate_speech_to_text():
    translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(
            subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = from_language
    for lang in to_languages:
        translation_config.add_target_language(lang)

    recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(
            translation_config=translation_config)
    
    print('Say something...')
    result = recognizer.recognize_once()
    synthesize_translations(result=result)

def synthesize_translations(result):
    language_to_voice_map = {
        "de": "de-DE-KatjaNeural",
        "en": "en-US-AriaNeural",
        "it": "it-IT-ElsaNeural",
        "pt": "pt-BR-FranciscaNeural",
        "zh-Hans": "zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural"
    }
    print(f'Recognized: "{result.text}"')

    for language in result.translations:
        translation = result.translations[language]
        print(f'Translated into "{language}": {translation}')

        speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)
        speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name = language_to_voice_map.get(language)
        
        audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioOutputConfig(filename=f'{language}-translation.wav')
        speech_synthesizer = speechsdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_config)
        speech_synthesizer.speak_text_async(translation).get()

translate_speech_to_text()
```
