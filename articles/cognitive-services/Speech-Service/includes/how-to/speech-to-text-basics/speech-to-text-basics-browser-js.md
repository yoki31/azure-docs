One of the core features of the Speech service is the ability to recognize and transcribe human speech (often called speech-to-text). In this sample, you learn how to use the Speech SDK in your apps and products to perform high-quality speech-to-text conversion.

## React sample on GitHub

Go to the [React sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample) on GitHub to learn how to use the Speech SDK in a browser-based JavaScript environment. This sample shows design patterns for the exchange and management of authentication tokens. It also shows the capture of audio from a microphone or file for speech-to-text conversions.

You can also use the design patterns in the [Node.js quickstart](../../../get-started-speech-to-text.md?pivots=programming-language-nodejs&tabs=script%2cbrowser%2cwindowsinstall) in a browser environment.
