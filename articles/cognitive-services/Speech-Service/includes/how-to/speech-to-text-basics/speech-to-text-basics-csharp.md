One of the core features of the Speech service is the ability to recognize and transcribe human speech (often called speech-to-text). In this quickstart, you learn how to use the Speech SDK in your apps and products to perform high-quality speech-to-text conversion.

## Skip to samples on GitHub

If you want to skip straight to sample code, see the [C# quickstart samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/csharp/dotnet) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and a Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and a subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

### Install the Speech SDK

If you just want the package name to get started, run `Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` in the NuGet console.

For platform-specific installation instructions, see the following links:

## Create a speech configuration

To call the Speech service by using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig) instance. This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated location/region, endpoint, host, or authorization token. 

Create a `SpeechConfig` instance by using your key and location/region. For more information, see [Find keys and location/region](../../../overview.md#find-keys-and-locationregion).

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    }
}
```

You can initialize `SpeechConfig` in a few other ways:

* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region/location.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

## Recognize speech from a microphone

To recognize speech by using your device microphone, create an [`AudioConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.audioconfig) instance by using `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`. Then initialize [`SpeechRecognizer`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer) by passing `audioConfig` and `speechConfig`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task FromMic(SpeechConfig speechConfig)
    {
        using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
        using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        Console.WriteLine("Speak into your microphone.");
        var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
    }

    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
        await FromMic(speechConfig);
    }
}
```

If you want to use a *specific* audio input device, you need to specify the device ID in `AudioConfig`. Learn [how to get the device ID](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md) for your audio input device.

## Recognize speech from a file

If you want to recognize speech from an audio file instead of a microphone, you still need to create an `AudioConfig` instance. But instead of calling `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`, you call `FromWavFileInput()` and pass the file path:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task FromFile(SpeechConfig speechConfig)
    {
        using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("PathToFile.wav");
        using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
    }

    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
        await FromFile(speechConfig);
    }
}
```

## Recognize speech from an in-memory stream

For many use cases, it's likely that your audio data will come from blob storage or will otherwise already be in memory as a `byte[]` instance or a similar raw data structure. The following example uses [`PushAudioInputStream`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.pushaudioinputstream) to recognize speech, which is essentially an abstracted memory stream. The sample code does the following:

* Writes raw audio data (PCM) to `PushAudioInputStream` by using the `Write()` function, which accepts a `byte[]` instance.
* Reads a `.wav` file by using `FileReader` for demonstration purposes. If you already have audio data in a `byte[]` instance, you can skip directly to writing the content to the input stream.
* The default format is 16-bit, 16-KHz mono PCM. To customize the format, you can pass an [`AudioStreamFormat`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.audiostreamformat) object to `CreatePushStream()` by using the static function `AudioStreamFormat.GetWaveFormatPCM(sampleRate, (byte)bitRate, (byte)channels)`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

class Program 
{
    async static Task FromStream(SpeechConfig speechConfig)
    {
        var reader = new BinaryReader(File.OpenRead("PathToFile.wav"));
        using var audioInputStream = AudioInputStream.CreatePushStream();
        using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromStreamInput(audioInputStream);
        using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        byte[] readBytes;
        do
        {
            readBytes = reader.ReadBytes(1024);
            audioInputStream.Write(readBytes, readBytes.Length);
        } while (readBytes.Length > 0);

        var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
    }

    async static Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
        await FromStream(speechConfig);
    }
}
```

Using a push stream as input assumes that the audio data is a raw PCM and skips any headers. The API will still work in certain cases if the header has not been skipped. But for the best results, consider implementing logic to read off the headers so that `byte[]` starts at the *start of the audio data*.

## Handle errors

The previous examples simply get the recognized text from `result.text`. To handle errors and other responses, you need to write some code to handle the result. The following code evaluates the [`result.Reason`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.recognitionresult.reason) property and:

* Prints the recognition result: `ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech`.
* If there is no recognition match, informs the user: `ResultReason.NoMatch`.
* If an error is encountered, prints the error message: `ResultReason.Canceled`.

```csharp
switch (result.Reason)
{
    case ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={result.Text}");
        break;
    case ResultReason.NoMatch:
        Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
        break;
    case ResultReason.Canceled:
        var cancellation = CancellationDetails.FromResult(result);
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");

        if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={cancellation.ErrorDetails}");
            Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the speech key and location/region info?");
        }
        break;
}
```

## Use continuous recognition

The previous examples use at-start recognition, which recognizes a single utterance. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed.

In contrast, you use continuous recognition when you want to control when to stop recognizing. It requires you to subscribe to the `Recognizing`, `Recognized`, and `Canceled` events to get the recognition results. To stop recognition, you must call [`StopContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.stopcontinuousrecognitionasync). Here's an example of how continuous recognition is performed on an audio input file.

Start by defining the input and initializing [`SpeechRecognizer`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer):

```csharp
using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
using var recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
```

Then create a `TaskCompletionSource<int>` instance to manage the state of speech recognition:

```csharp
var stopRecognition = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();
```

Next, subscribe to the events that `SpeechRecognizer` sends:

* [`Recognizing`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.recognizing): Signal for events that contain intermediate recognition results.
* [`Recognized`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.recognized): Signal for events that contain final recognition results, which indicate a successful recognition attempt.
* [`SessionStopped`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer.sessionstopped): Signal for events that indicate the end of a recognition session (operation).
* [`Canceled`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.canceled): Signal for events that contain canceled recognition results. These results indicate a recognition attempt that was canceled as a result or a direct cancellation request. Alternatively, they indicate a transport or protocol failure.

```csharp
recognizer.Recognizing += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZING: Text={e.Result.Text}");
};

recognizer.Recognized += (s, e) =>
{
    if (e.Result.Reason == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={e.Result.Text}");
    }
    else if (e.Result.Reason == ResultReason.NoMatch)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
    }
};

recognizer.Canceled += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={e.Reason}");

    if (e.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={e.ErrorDetails}");
        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the speech key and location/region info?");
    }

    stopRecognition.TrySetResult(0);
};

recognizer.SessionStopped += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("\n    Session stopped event.");
    stopRecognition.TrySetResult(0);
};
```

With everything set up, call `StartContinuousRecognitionAsync` to start recognizing:

```csharp
await recognizer.StartContinuousRecognitionAsync();

// Waits for completion. Use Task.WaitAny to keep the task rooted.
Task.WaitAny(new[] { stopRecognition.Task });

// Make the following call at some point to stop recognition:
// await recognizer.StopContinuousRecognitionAsync();
```

### Dictation mode

When you're using continuous recognition, you can enable dictation processing by using the corresponding function. This mode will cause the speech configuration instance to interpret word descriptions of sentence structures such as punctuation. For example, the utterance "Do you live in town question mark" would be interpreted as the text "Do you live in town?".

To enable dictation mode, use the [`EnableDictation`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.enabledictation) method on [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig):

```csharp
speechConfig.EnableDictation();
```

## Change the source language

A common task for speech recognition is specifying the input (or source) language. The following example shows how you would change the input language to Italian. In your code, find your [`SpeechConfig`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig) instance and add this line directly below it:

```csharp
speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";
```

The [`SpeechRecognitionLanguage`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.speechrecognitionlanguage) property expects a language-locale format string. You can provide any value in the **Locale** column in the [list of supported locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).
