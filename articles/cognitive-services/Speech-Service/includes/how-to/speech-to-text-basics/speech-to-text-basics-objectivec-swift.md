You can transcribe speech into text by using the Speech SDK for Swift and Objective-C.

## Prerequisites

The following samples assume that you have an Azure account and a Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and a subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

## Install Speech SDK and samples

The [Cognitive Services Speech SDK](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk) contains samples written in Swift and Objective-C for iOS and Mac. Select a link to see installation instructions for each sample:
