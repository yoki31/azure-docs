One of the core features of the Speech service is the ability to recognize and transcribe human speech (often called speech-to-text). In this quickstart, you learn how to use the Speech SDK in your apps and products to perform high-quality speech-to-text conversion.

## Skip to samples on GitHub

If you want to skip straight to sample code, see the [Java quickstart samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/java/jre) on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and a Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and a subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

### Install the Speech SDK

Before you can do anything, you need to install the Speech SDK. Depending on your platform, use the following instructions:

* <a href="/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-java&tabs=jre" target="_blank">Java Runtime </a>
* <a href="/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-java&tabs=android" target="_blank">Android </a>

## Create a speech configuration

To call the Speech service by using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechConfig`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig) instance. This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated location/region, endpoint, host, or authorization token. 

Create a `SpeechConfig` instance by using your key and location/region. For more information, see [Find keys and location/region](../../../overview.md#find-keys-and-locationregion).

```java
import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.*;
import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.AudioConfig;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        SpeechConfig speechConfig = SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
    }
}
```

You can initialize `SpeechConfig` in a few other ways:

* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

## Recognize speech from a microphone

To recognize speech by using your device microphone, create an `AudioConfig` instance by using `fromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`. Then initialize [`SpeechRecognizer`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer) by passing `audioConfig` and `config`.

```java
import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.*;
import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.AudioConfig;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        SpeechConfig speechConfig = SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
        fromMic(speechConfig);
    }

    public static void fromMic(SpeechConfig speechConfig) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
        SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

        System.out.println("Speak into your microphone.");
        Future<SpeechRecognitionResult> task = recognizer.recognizeOnceAsync();
        SpeechRecognitionResult result = task.get();
        System.out.println("RECOGNIZED: Text=" + result.getText());
    }
}
```

If you want to use a *specific* audio input device, you need to specify the device ID in `AudioConfig`. Learn [how to get the device ID](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md) for your audio input device.

## Recognize speech from a file

If you want to recognize speech from an audio file instead of using a microphone, you still need to create an `AudioConfig` instance. But instead of calling `fromDefaultMicrophoneInput()`, you call `fromWavFileInput()` and pass the file path:

```java
import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.*;
import com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.audio.AudioConfig;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        SpeechConfig speechConfig = SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-subscription-key>", "<paste-your-region>");
        fromFile(speechConfig);
    }

    public static void fromFile(SpeechConfig speechConfig) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
        SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
        
        Future<SpeechRecognitionResult> task = recognizer.recognizeOnceAsync();
        SpeechRecognitionResult result = task.get();
        System.out.println("RECOGNIZED: Text=" + result.getText());
    }
}
```

## Handle errors

The previous examples simply get the recognized text by using `result.getText()`. To handle errors and other responses, you need to write some code to handle the result. The following example evaluates [`result.getReason()`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.recognitionresult.getreason) and:

* Prints the recognition result: `ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech`.
* If there is no recognition match, informs the user: `ResultReason.NoMatch`.
* If an error is encountered, prints the error message: `ResultReason.Canceled`.

```java
switch (result.getReason()) {
    case ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
        System.out.println("We recognized: " + result.getText());
        exitCode = 0;
        break;
    case ResultReason.NoMatch:
        System.out.println("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
        break;
    case ResultReason.Canceled: {
            CancellationDetails cancellation = CancellationDetails.fromResult(result);
            System.out.println("CANCELED: Reason=" + cancellation.getReason());

            if (cancellation.getReason() == CancellationReason.Error) {
                System.out.println("CANCELED: ErrorCode=" + cancellation.getErrorCode());
                System.out.println("CANCELED: ErrorDetails=" + cancellation.getErrorDetails());
                System.out.println("CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
            }
        }
        break;
}
```

## Use continuous recognition

The previous examples use at-start recognition, which recognizes a single utterance. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed.

In contrast, you use continuous recognition when you want to control when to stop recognizing. It requires you to subscribe to the `recognizing`, `recognized`, and `canceled` events to get the recognition results. To stop recognition, you must call [`stopContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.stopcontinuousrecognitionasync). Here's an example of how continuous recognition is performed on an audio input file.

Start by defining the input and initializing [`SpeechRecognizer`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer):

```java
AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(config, audioConfig);
```

Next, create a variable to manage the state of speech recognition. Declare a `Semaphore` instance at the class scope:

```java
private static Semaphore stopTranslationWithFileSemaphore;
```

Next, subscribe to the events that [`SpeechRecognizer`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer) sends:

* [`recognizing`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.recognizing): Signal for events that contain intermediate recognition results.
* [`recognized`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.recognized): Signal for events that contain final recognition results, which indicate a successful recognition attempt.
* [`sessionStopped`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.recognizer.sessionstopped): Signal for events that indicate the end of a recognition session (operation).
* [`canceled`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.canceled): Signal for events that contain canceled recognition results. These results indicate a recognition attempt that was canceled as a result or a direct cancellation request. Alternatively, they indicate a transport or protocol failure.

```java
// First initialize the semaphore.
stopTranslationWithFileSemaphore = new Semaphore(0);

recognizer.recognizing.addEventListener((s, e) -> {
    System.out.println("RECOGNIZING: Text=" + e.getResult().getText());
});

recognizer.recognized.addEventListener((s, e) -> {
    if (e.getResult().getReason() == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech) {
        System.out.println("RECOGNIZED: Text=" + e.getResult().getText());
    }
    else if (e.getResult().getReason() == ResultReason.NoMatch) {
        System.out.println("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
    }
});

recognizer.canceled.addEventListener((s, e) -> {
    System.out.println("CANCELED: Reason=" + e.getReason());

    if (e.getReason() == CancellationReason.Error) {
        System.out.println("CANCELED: ErrorCode=" + e.getErrorCode());
        System.out.println("CANCELED: ErrorDetails=" + e.getErrorDetails());
        System.out.println("CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
    }

    stopTranslationWithFileSemaphore.release();
});

recognizer.sessionStopped.addEventListener((s, e) -> {
    System.out.println("\n    Session stopped event.");
    stopTranslationWithFileSemaphore.release();
});
```

With everything set up, call [`startContinuousRecognitionAsync`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechrecognizer.startcontinuousrecognitionasync) to start recognizing:

```java
// Starts continuous recognition. Uses StopContinuousRecognitionAsync() to stop recognition.
recognizer.startContinuousRecognitionAsync().get();

// Waits for completion.
stopTranslationWithFileSemaphore.acquire();

// Stops recognition.
recognizer.stopContinuousRecognitionAsync().get();
```

### Dictation mode

When you're using continuous recognition, you can enable dictation processing by using the corresponding function. This mode will cause the speech configuration instance to interpret word descriptions of sentence structures such as punctuation. For example, the utterance "Do you live in town question mark" would be interpreted as the text "Do you live in town?".

To enable dictation mode, use the [`enableDictation`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.enabledictation) method on [`SpeechConfig`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig):

```java
config.enableDictation();
```

## Change the source language

A common task for speech recognition is specifying the input (or source) language. The following example shows how you would change the input language to French. In your code, find your [`SpeechConfig`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig) instance and add this line directly below it:

```java
config.setSpeechRecognitionLanguage("fr-FR");
```

[`setSpeechRecognitionLanguage`](/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.setspeechrecognitionlanguage) is a parameter that takes a string as an argument. You can provide any value in the [list of supported locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).
