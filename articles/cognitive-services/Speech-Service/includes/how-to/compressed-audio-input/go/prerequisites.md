Speech SDK can use [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) to handle compressed audio. For licensing reasons, GStreamer binaries aren't compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. You need to install several dependencies and plug-ins. For more information, see [Installing on Linux](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c). Go language is only supported in the Speech SDK on the Linux platform. To get started with the Microsoft Speech SDK in Go, see [Speech SDK for Go](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-go&tabs=dotnet%252cwindows%252cjre%252cbrowser).
