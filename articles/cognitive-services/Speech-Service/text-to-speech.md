# What is text-to-speech?

In this overview, you learn about the benefits and capabilities of the text-to-speech feature of the Speech service, which is part of Azure Cognitive Services. 

Text-to-speech enables your applications, tools, or devices to convert text into humanlike synthesized speech. The text-to-speech capability is also known as speech synthesis. Use humanlike prebuilt neural voices out of the box, or create a custom neural voice that's unique to your product or brand. For a full list of supported voices, languages, and locales, see [Language and voice support for the Speech service](language-support.md#text-to-speech).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Bing Speech was decommissioned on October 15, 2019. If your applications, tools, or products are using the Bing Speech APIs or Custom Speech, see [Migrate from Bing Speech to the Speech service](how-to-migrate-from-bing-speech.md).

## Core features

Text-to-speech includes the following features:  

| Feature| Summary | Demo |
|--------|----|------|
| Prebuilt neural voice (called *Neural* on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/)) | Highly natural out-of-the-box voices. Create an Azure account and Speech service subscription, and then use the [Speech SDK](./get-started-text-to-speech.md) or visit the [Speech Studio portal](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal) and select prebuilt neural voices to get started. Check the [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/). | Check the [voice samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#overview) and determine the right voice for your business needs. |
| Custom neural voice (called *Custom Neural* on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/)) | Easy-to-use self-service for creating a natural brand voice, with limited access for responsible use. Create an Azure account and Speech service subscription (with the S0 tier), and [apply](https://aka.ms/customneural) to use the custom neural feature. After you've been granted access, visit the [Speech Studio portal](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal) and select **Custom Voice** to get started. Check the [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/). | Check the [voice samples](https://aka.ms/customvoice). |

### More about neural text-to-speech features
The text-to-speech feature of the Speech service on Azure has been fully upgraded to the neural text-to-speech engine. This engine uses deep neural networks to make the voices of computers nearly indistinguishable from the recordings of people. With the clear articulation of words, neural text-to-speech significantly reduces listening fatigue when users interact with AI systems.

The patterns of stress and intonation in spoken language are called _prosody_. Traditional text-to-speech systems break down prosody into separate linguistic analysis and acoustic prediction steps that are governed by independent models. That can result in muffled, buzzy voice synthesis. 

Here's more information about neural text-to-speech features in the Speech service, and how they overcome the limits of traditional text-to-speech systems:

* **Real-time speech synthesis**: Use the [Speech SDK](./get-started-text-to-speech.md) or [REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md) to convert text-to-speech by using [prebuilt neural voices](language-support.md#text-to-speech) or [custom neural voices](custom-neural-voice.md).

* **Asynchronous synthesis of long audio**: Use the [Long Audio API](long-audio-api.md) to asynchronously synthesize text-to-speech files longer than 10 minutes (for example, audio books or lectures). Unlike synthesis performed via the Speech SDK or speech-to-text REST API, responses aren't returned in real time. The expectation is that requests are sent asynchronously, responses are polled for, and synthesized audio is downloaded when the service makes it available.

* **Prebuilt neural voices**: Microsoft neural text-to-speech capability uses deep neural networks to overcome the limits of traditional speech synthesis with regard to stress and intonation in spoken language. Prosody prediction and voice synthesis happen simultaneously, which results in more fluid and natural-sounding outputs. You can use neural voices to:

  - Make interactions with chatbots and voice assistants more natural and engaging.
  - Convert digital texts such as e-books into audiobooks.
  - Enhance in-car navigation systems. 
  
  For a full list of platform neural voices, see [Language and voice support for the Speech service](language-support.md#text-to-speech).

* **Fine-tuning text-to-speech output with SSML**: Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an XML-based markup language that's used to customize text-to-speech outputs. With SSML, you can adjust pitch, add pauses, improve pronunciation, change speaking rate, adjust volume, and attribute multiple voices to a single document. 

  You can use SSML to define your own lexicons or switch to different speaking styles. With the [multilingual voices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/azure-text-to-speech-updates-at-build-2021/ba-p/2382981), you can also adjust the speaking languages via SSML. To fine-tune the voice output for your scenario, see [Improve synthesis with Speech Synthesis Markup Language](speech-synthesis-markup.md).

* **Visemes**: [Visemes](how-to-speech-synthesis-viseme.md) are the key poses in observed speech, including the position of the lips, jaw, and tongue in producing a particular phoneme. Visemes have a strong correlation with voices and phonemes. 

  By using viseme events in Speech SDK, you can generate facial animation data. This data can be used to animate faces in lip-reading communication, education, entertainment, and customer service. Viseme is currently supported only for the `en-US` (US English) [neural voices](language-support.md#text-to-speech).

> [!NOTE]
> We plan to retire the traditional/standard voices and non-neural custom voice in 2024. After that, we'll no longer support them. 
>
> If your applications, tools, or products are using any of the standard voices and custom voices, we've created guides to help you migrate to the neural version. For more information, see [Migrate to neural voices](migration-overview-neural-voice.md).

## Get started

To get started with text-to-speech, see the [quickstart](get-started-text-to-speech.md). Text-to-speech is available via the [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md), the [REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md), and the [Speech CLI](spx-overview.md).

## Sample code

Sample code for text-to-speech is available on GitHub. These samples cover text-to-speech conversion in most popular programming languages:

* [Text-to-speech samples (SDK)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk)
* [Text-to-speech samples (REST)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Speech-TTS)

## Custom neural voice

In addition to prebuilt neural voices, you can create and fine-tune custom neural voices that are unique to your product or brand. All it takes to get started is a handful of audio files and the associated transcriptions. For more information, see [Get started with custom neural voice](how-to-custom-voice.md).

## Pricing note

When you use the text-to-speech feature, you're billed for each character that's converted to speech, including punctuation. Although the SSML document itself is not billable, optional elements that are used to adjust how the text is converted to speech, like phonemes and pitch, are counted as billable characters. Here's a list of what's billable:

* Text passed to the text-to-speech feature in the SSML body of the request
* All markup within the text field of the request body in the SSML format, except for `<speak>` and `<voice>` tags
* Letters, punctuation, spaces, tabs, markup, and all white-space characters
* Every code point defined in Unicode

For detailed information, see [Speech service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each Chinese character is counted as two characters for billing, including kanji used in Japanese, hanja used in Korean, or hanzi used in other languages.
