# Get started with the Azure Speech CLI

In this article, you'll learn how to use the Azure Speech CLI (also called SPX) to access Speech services such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech translation, without having to write any code. The Speech CLI is production ready, and you can use it to automate simple workflows in the Speech service by using `.bat` or shell scripts.

This article assumes that you have working knowledge of the Command Prompt window, terminal, or PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> In PowerShell, the [stop-parsing token](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_special_characters#stop-parsing-token---) (`--%`) should follow `spx`. For example, run `spx --% config @region` to view the current region config value.

[!INCLUDE [](includes/spx-setup.md)]


## Create a subscription configuration

# [Terminal](#tab/terminal)

To get started, you need an Azure subscription key and region identifier (for example, `eastus`, `westus`). To learn how to get these credentials, see the [Speech service overview](overview.md#find-keys-and-locationregion) documentation.

To configure your subscription key and region identifier, run the following commands:  

```console
spx config @key --set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY
spx config @region --set REGION
```

The key and region are stored for future Speech CLI commands. To view the current configuration, run the following commands:

```console
spx config @key
spx config @region
```

As needed, include the `clear` option to remove either stored value:

```console
spx config @key --clear
spx config @region --clear
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To get started, you need an Azure subscription key and region identifier (for example, `eastus`, `westus`). To learn how to get these credentials, see the [Speech service overview](overview.md#find-keys-and-locationregion) documentation.

To configure your subscription key and region identifier, run the following commands in PowerShell: 

```powershell
spx --% config @key --set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY
spx --% config @region --set REGION
```

The key and region are stored for future SPX commands. To view the current configuration, run the following commands:

```powershell
spx --% config @key
spx --% config @region
```

As needed, include the `clear` option to remove either stored value:

```powershell
spx --% config @key --clear
spx --% config @region --clear
```

***

## Basic usage

This section shows a few basic SPX commands that are often useful for first-time testing and experimentation. Start by viewing the help that's built into the tool by running the following command:

```console
spx
```

You can search help topics by keyword. For example, to see a list of Speech CLI usage examples, run the following command:

```console
spx help find --topics "examples"
```

To see options for the recognize command, run the following command:

```console
spx help recognize
```

Additional help commands are listed in the console output. You can enter these commands to get detailed help about subcommands.

## Speech-to-text (speech recognition)

To convert speech to text (speech recognition) by using your system's default microphone, run the following command: 

```console
spx recognize --microphone
```

After you run the command, SPX begins listening for audio on the current active input device. It stops listening when you select **Enter**. The spoken audio is then recognized and converted to text in the console output.

With the Speech CLI, you can also recognize speech from an audio file. Run the following command:

```console
spx recognize --file /path/to/file.wav
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a Docker container, `--microphone` will not work.
> 
> If you're recognizing speech from an audio file in a Docker container, make sure that the audio file is located in the directory that you mounted previously.

> [!TIP]
> If you get stuck or want to learn more about the Speech CLI recognition options, you can run ```spx help recognize```.

## Text-to-speech (speech synthesis)

The following command takes text as input and then outputs the synthesized speech to the current active output device (for example, your computer speakers).

```console
spx synthesize --text "Testing synthesis using the Speech CLI" --speakers
```

You can also save the synthesized output to a file. In this example, let's create a file named *my-sample.wav* in the directory where you're running the command.

```console
spx synthesize --text "Enjoy using the Speech CLI." --audio output my-sample.wav
```

These examples presume that you're testing in English. However, Speech service supports speech synthesis in many languages. You can pull down a full list of voices either by running the following command or by visiting the [language support page](./language-support.md).

```console
spx synthesize --voices
```

Here's a command for using one of the voices you've discovered.

```console
spx synthesize --text "Bienvenue chez moi." --voice fr-CA-Caroline --speakers
```

> [!TIP]
> If you get stuck or want to learn more about the Speech CLI recognition options, you can run ```spx help synthesize```.

## Speech-to-text translation

With the Speech CLI, you can also do speech-to-text translation. Run the following command to capture audio from your default microphone and output the translation as text. Keep in mind that you need to supply the `source` and `target` language with the `translate` command.

```console
spx translate --microphone --source en-US --target ru-RU
```

When you're translating into multiple languages, separate the language codes with a semicolon (`;`).

```console
spx translate --microphone --source en-US --target ru-RU;fr-FR;es-ES
```

If you want to save the output of your translation, use the `--output` flag. In this example, you'll also read from a file.

```console
spx translate --file /some/file/path/input.wav --source en-US --target ru-RU --output file /some/file/path/russian_translation.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of all supported languages and their corresponding locale codes, see [Language and voice support for the Speech service](language-support.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you get stuck or want to learn more about the Speech CLI recognition options, you can run ```spx help translate```.
