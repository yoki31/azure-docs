# Stream codec-compressed audio

The Speech SDK and Speech CLI use GStreamer to support different kinds of input audio formats. GStreamer decompresses the audio before it's sent over the wire to the Speech service as raw PCM.

[!INCLUDE [supported-audio-formats](includes/supported-audio-formats.md)]

## Install GStreamer

Choose a platform for installation instructions.

Platform | Languages | Supported GStreamer version
| :--- | ---: | :---:
Android  | Java | [1.18.3](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/android/1.18.3/)
Linux  | C++, C#, Java, Python, Go | [Supported Linux distributions and target architectures](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md)
Windows (excluding UWP) | C++, C#, Java, Python | [1.18.3](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.18.3/msvc/gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.18.3.msi)

### [Android](#tab/android)

For more information about building libgstreamer_android.so, see [GStreamer configuration by programming language](#gstreamer-configuration).

For more information, see [Android installation instructions](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/for-android-development.html?gi-language=c).

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

For more information, see [Linux installation instructions](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c).  

```sh
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-0 \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
```
### [Windows](#tab/windows)

Make sure that packages of the same platform (x64 or x86) are installed. For example, if you installed the x64 package for Python, you need to install the x64 GStreamer package. The following instructions are for the x64 packages.

1. Create the folder c:\gstreamer.
1. Download the [installer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.18.3/msvc/gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.18.3.msi).
1. Copy the installer to c:\gstreamer.
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
1. Run the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    cd c:\gstreamer
    msiexec /passive INSTALLLEVEL=1000 INSTALLDIR=C:\gstreamer /i gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.18.3.msi
    ```

1. Add the system variables GST_PLUGIN_PATH with the value C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\lib\gstreamer-1.0.
1. Add the system variables GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86_64 with the value C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64.
1. Add another entry in the path variable as C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\bin.
1. Reboot the machine.

For more information about GStreamer, see [Windows installation instructions](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-windows.html?gi-language=c).
