# Azure Cognitive Services containers

Azure Cognitive Services provides several [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container) that let you use the same APIs that are available in Azure, on-premises. Using these containers gives you the flexibility to bring Cognitive Services closer to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons. Container support is currently available for a subset of Azure Cognitive Services.

Containerization is an approach to software distribution in which an application or service, including its dependencies & configuration, is packaged together as a container image. With little or no modification, a container image can be deployed on a container host. Containers are isolated from each other and the underlying operating system, with a smaller footprint than a virtual machine. Containers can be instantiated from container images for short-term tasks, and removed when no longer needed.

## Features and benefits

- **Immutable infrastructure**: Enable DevOps teams' to leverage a consistent and reliable set of known system parameters, while being able to adapt to change. Containers provide the flexibility to pivot within a predictable ecosystem and avoid configuration drift.
- **Control over data**: Choose where your data gets processed by Cognitive Services. This can be essential if you can't send data to the cloud but need access to Cognitive Services APIs. Support consistency in hybrid environments â€“ across data, management, identity, and security.
- **Control over model updates**: Flexibility in versioning and updating of models deployed in their solutions.
- **Portable architecture**: Enables the creation of a portable application architecture that can be deployed on Azure, on-premises and the edge. Containers can be deployed directly to [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks/index.yml), [Azure Container Instances](../container-instances/index.yml), or to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster deployed to [Azure Stack](/azure-stack/operator). For more information, see [Deploy Kubernetes to Azure Stack](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-solution-template-kubernetes-deploy).
- **High throughput / low latency**: Provide customers the ability to scale for high throughput and low latency requirements by enabling Cognitive Services to run physically close to their application logic and data. Containers do not cap transactions per second (TPS) and can be made to scale both up and out to handle demand if you provide the necessary hardware resources.
- **Scalability**: With the ever growing popularity of containerization and container orchestration software, such as Kubernetes; scalability is at the forefront of technological advancements. Building on a scalable cluster foundation, application development caters to high availability.

## Containers in Azure Cognitive Services

Azure Cognitive Services containers provide the following set of Docker containers, each of which contains a subset of functionality from services in Azure Cognitive Services. You can find instructions and image locations in the tables below. A list of [container images](containers/container-image-tags.md) is also available.

Additionally, some containers are supported in the Cognitive Services [multi-service resource](cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) offering. You can create one single Cognitive Services All-In-One resource and use the same billing key across supported services for the following services:

* Computer Vision
* LUIS
* Language service

## Prerequisites

You must satisfy the following prerequisites before using Azure Cognitive Services containers:

**Docker Engine**: You must have Docker Engine installed locally. Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). On Windows, Docker must be configured to support Linux containers. Docker containers can also be deployed directly to [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks/index.yml) or [Azure Container Instances](../container-instances/index.yml).

Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure.

**Familiarity with Microsoft Container Registry and Docker**: You should have a basic understanding of both Microsoft Container Registry and Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker` commands.

For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).

Individual containers can have their own requirements, as well, including server and memory allocation requirements.
