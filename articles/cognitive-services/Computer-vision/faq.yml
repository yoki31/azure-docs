      - question: |
          How can I increase the transactions-per-second (TPS) allowed by the service?
        answer: |
          The free (S0) tier only allows 20 transaction per minute. Upgrade to the S1 tier to get up to 30 transactions per second. If you're seeing the error code 429 and the "Too many requests" error message, [submit an Azure support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) to raise your TPS to 50 or higher with a brief business justification.

      - question: |
          The service is throwing an error because my image file is too large. How can I work around this? 
        answer: |
          The file size limit for most Computer Vision features is 4MB, but the client library SDKs can handle files up to 6MB. For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that handles multi-page documents, the maximum file size is 50 MB. For more information, see the Image [Analysis inputs limits](overview-image-analysis.md#image-requirements) and [OCR input limits](overview-ocr.md#input-requirements).

      - question: |
          How can I process multi-page documents with OCR in a single call?
        answer: |
          Optical Character Recognition, specifically the Read operation, supports multi-page documents as the API input. If you call the API with a 10-page document, you'll be billed for 10 pages, with each page counted as a billable transaction. Note that if you have the free (S0) tier, it can only process two pages at a time.

      - question: |
          Can I send multiple images in a single API call to the Computer Vision service?
        answer: |
          This function is not currently available.
      - question: |
          How many languages are supported for Image Analysis and OCR?
        answer: |
          Please see the [Language support](language-support.md) page for the list of languages covered by Image Analysis and OCR.

      - question: |
          Can I train Computer Vision API to use custom tags?  For example, I would like to feed in pictures of cat breeds to 'train' the AI, then receive the breed value on an AI request.
        answer: |
          This function is currently not available. You can use [Custom Vision](../custom-vision-service/overview.md) to train a model to detect user-defined visual features.

      - question: |
          Can I deploy the OCR (Read) capability on-premise?
        answer: |
          Yes, the OCR (Read) cloud API is also available as a Docker container for on-premise deployment. Learn [how to deploy the OCR containers](./computer-vision-how-to-install-containers.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can Computer Vision be used to read license plates?
        answer: |
          The Vision API includes the deep learning powered OCR capabilities with the latest Read feature. It is important to note that, at this time, the Computer Vision API is not optimized for license plate recognition (LPR). Although in some cases license plate text will be recognized, additional processing of the returned data might be needed to strip out state or province names and invalid characters. We are constantly trying to improve our services to work across all scenarios.
