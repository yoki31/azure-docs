# Create and provision an IoT Edge device on Linux using symmetric keys

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-201806-or-202011](../../includes/iot-edge-version-201806-or-202011.md)]

This article provides end-to-end instructions for registering and provisioning a Linux IoT Edge device, including installing IoT Edge.

Every device that connects to an IoT hub has a device ID that's used to track cloud-to-device or device-to-cloud communications. You configure a device with its connection information, which includes the IoT hub hostname, the device ID, and the information the device uses to authenticate to IoT Hub.

The steps in this article walk through a process called manual provisioning, where you connect a single device to its IoT hub. For manual provisioning, you have two options for authenticating IoT Edge devices:

* **Symmetric keys**: When you create a new device identity in IoT Hub, the service creates two keys. You place one of the keys on the device, and it presents the key to IoT Hub when authenticating.

  This authentication method is faster to get started, but not as secure.

* **X.509 self-signed**: You create two X.509 identity certificates and place them on the device. When you create a new device identity in IoT Hub, you provide thumbprints from both certificates. When the device authenticates to IoT Hub, it presents one certificate and IoT Hub verifies that the certificate matches its thumbprint.

  This authentication method is more secure and recommended for production scenarios.

This article covers using symmetric keys as your authentication method. If you want to use X.509 certificates, see [Create and provision an IoT Edge device on Linux using X.509 certificates](how-to-provision-single-device-linux-x509.md).

## Provision the device with its cloud identity

Now that the container engine and the IoT Edge runtime are installed on your device, you're ready for the next step, which is to set up the device with its cloud identity and authentication information.

<!-- 1.1 -->
::: moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

On the IoT Edge device, open the configuration file.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
   ```

Find the provisioning configurations of the file and uncomment the **Manual provisioning configuration using a connection string** section, if it isn't already uncommented.

   ```yml
   # Manual provisioning configuration using a connection string
   provisioning:
     source: "manual"
     device_connection_string: "ADD_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
   ```

Update the value of **device_connection_string** with the connection string from your IoT Edge device. Make sure that any other provisioning sections are commented out. Make sure the **provisioning:** line has no preceding whitespace and that nested items are indented by two spaces.

To paste clipboard contents into Nano `Shift+Right Click` or press `Shift+Insert`.

Save and close the file.

   `CTRL + X`, `Y`, `Enter`

After entering the provisioning information in the configuration file, restart the daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart iotedge
   ```

<!-- end 1.1 -->
::: moniker-end

<!-- 1.2 -->
::: moniker range=">=iotedge-2020-11"

You can quickly configure your IoT Edge device with symmetric key authentication using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config mp --connection-string 'PASTE_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE'
   ```

   The `iotedge config mp` command creates a configuration file on the device and enters your connection string in the file.

Apply the configuration changes.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge config apply
   ```

If you want to see the configuration file, you can open it:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
   ```

<!-- end 1.2 -->
::: moniker-end

## Verify successful configuration

Verify that the runtime was successfully installed and configured on your IoT Edge device.

>[!TIP]
>You need elevated privileges to run `iotedge` commands. Once you sign out of your machine and sign back in the first time after installing the IoT Edge runtime, your permissions are automatically updated. Until then, use `sudo` in front of the commands.

Check to see that the IoT Edge system service is running.

<!-- 1.1 -->
::: moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status iotedge
   ```

::: moniker-end

<!-- 1.2 -->
::: moniker range=">=iotedge-2020-11"

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge system status
   ```

A successful status response is `Ok`.

::: moniker-end

If you need to troubleshoot the service, retrieve the service logs.

<!-- 1.1 -->
::: moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

   ```bash
   journalctl -u iotedge
   ```

::: moniker-end

<!-- 1.2 -->
::: moniker range=">=iotedge-2020-11"

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge system logs
   ```

::: moniker-end

Use the `check` tool to verify configuration and connection status of the device.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge check
   ```

>[!TIP]
>Always use `sudo` to run the check tool, even after your permissions are updated. The tool needs elevated privileges to access the config file to verify configuration status.

View all the modules running on your IoT Edge device. When the service starts for the first time, you should only see the **edgeAgent** module running. The edgeAgent module runs by default and helps to install and start any additional modules that you deploy to your device.

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge list
   ```

When you create a new IoT Edge device, it will display the status code `417 -- The device's deployment configuration is not set` in the Azure portal. This status is normal, and means that the device is ready to receive a module deployment.

## Offline or specific version installation (optional)

The steps in this section are for scenarios not covered by the standard installation steps. This may include:

* Install IoT Edge while offline
* Install a release candidate version

Use the steps in this section if you want to install a specific version of the Azure IoT Edge runtime that isn't available through `apt-get install`. The Microsoft package list only contains a limited set of recent versions and their sub-versions, so these steps are for anyone who wants to install an older version or a release candidate version.

Using curl commands, you can target the component files directly from the IoT Edge GitHub repository.

<!-- 1.1 -->
::: moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

1. Navigate to the [Azure IoT Edge releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases), and find the release version that you want to target.

2. Expand the **Assets** section for that version.

3. Every release should have new files for the IoT Edge security daemon and the hsmlib. If you're going to install IoT Edge on an offline device, download these files ahead of time. Otherwise, use the following commands to update those components.

   1. Find the **libiothsm-std** file that matches your IoT Edge device's architecture. Right-click on the file link and copy the link address.

   2. Use the copied link in the following command to install that version of the hsmlib:

      ```bash
      curl -L libiothsm-std_link_here -o libiothsm-std.deb && sudo apt-get install ./libiothsm-std.deb
      ```

   3. Find the **iotedge** file that matches your IoT Edge device's architecture. Right-click on the file link and copy the link address.

   4. Use the copied link in the following command to install that version of the IoT Edge security daemon.

      ```bash
      curl -L iotedge_link_here -o iotedge.deb && sudo apt-get install ./iotedge.deb
      ```

<!-- end 1.1 -->
::: moniker-end

<!-- 1.2 -->
::: moniker range=">=iotedge-2020-11"

>[!NOTE]
>If your device is currently running IoT Edge version 1.1 or older, uninstall the **iotedge** and **libiothsm-std** packages before following the steps in this section. For more information, see [Update from 1.0 or 1.1 to 1.2](how-to-update-iot-edge.md#special-case-update-from-10-or-11-to-12).

1. Navigate to the [Azure IoT Edge releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iotedge/releases), and find the release version that you want to target.

2. Expand the **Assets** section for that version.

3. Every release should have new files for IoT Edge and the identity service. If you're going to install IoT Edge on an offline device, download these files ahead of time. Otherwise, use the following commands to update those components.

   1. Find the **aziot-identity-service** file that matches your IoT Edge device's architecture. Right-click on the file link and copy the link address.

   2. Use the copied link in the following command to install that version of the identity service:

      ```bash
      curl -L <identity service link> -o aziot-identity-service.deb && sudo apt-get install ./aziot-identity-service.deb
      ```

   3. Find the **aziot-edge** file that matches your IoT Edge device's architecture. Right-click on the file link and copy the link address.

   4. Use the copied link in the following command to install that version of IoT Edge.

      ```bash
      curl -L <iotedge link> -o aziot-edge.deb && sudo apt-get install ./aziot-edge.deb
      ```

<!-- end 1.2 -->
::: moniker-end

Now that the container engine and the IoT Edge runtime are installed on your device, you're ready for the next step, which is to [Provision the device with its cloud identity](#provision-the-device-with-its-cloud-identity).

## Uninstall IoT Edge

If you want to remove the IoT Edge installation from your device, use the following commands.

Remove the IoT Edge runtime.

<!-- 1.1 -->
::: moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

```bash
sudo apt-get remove iotedge
```

::: moniker-end

<!-- 1.2 -->
::: moniker range=">=iotedge-2020-11"

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge aziot-edge
```

::: moniker-end

Use the `--purge` flag if you want to delete all the files associated with IoT Edge, including your configuration files. Leave this flag out if you want to reinstall IoT Edge and use the same configuration information in the future.

When the IoT Edge runtime is removed, any containers that it created are stopped but still exist on your device. View all containers to see which ones remain.

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

Delete the containers from your device, including the two runtime containers.

```bash
sudo docker rm -f <container name>
```

Finally, remove the container runtime from your device.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge moby-cli
sudo apt-get remove --purge moby-engine
```
