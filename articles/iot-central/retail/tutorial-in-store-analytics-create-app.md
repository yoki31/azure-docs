# Tutorial: Deploy and walk through the in-store analytics application template

For many retailers, environmental conditions within their stores are a key differentiator from their competitors. Retailers want to maintain pleasant conditions within their stores for the benefit of their customers.  

You can use the IoT Central in-store analytics condition monitoring application template to build an end-to-end solution. The application template lets you digitally connect to and monitor a retail store environment using different kinds of sensor devices. These sensor devices generate telemetry that you can convert into business insights to help the retailer reduce operating costs and create a great experience for their customers.

Use the application template to:

- Connect different kinds of IoT sensors to an IoT Central application instance.
- Monitor and manage the health of the sensor network and any gateway devices in the environment.
- Create custom rules around the environmental conditions within a store to trigger  alerts for store managers.
- Transform the environmental conditions within your store into insights that the retail store team can use to improve the customer experience.
- Export the aggregated insights into existing or new business applications to provide useful and timely information to retail staff.

The application template comes with a set of device templates and uses a set of simulated devices to populate the dashboard.

Use the IoT Central *in-store analytics* application template and the guidance in this article to develop an end-to-end in-store analytics solution.

1. Gateway devices sending telemetry and aggregated insights to IoT Central.
1. Continuous data export to the desired Azure service for manipulation.
1. Data can be structured in the desired format and sent to a storage service.
1. Business applications can query data and generate insights that power retail operations.

## Condition monitoring sensors

An IoT solution starts with a set of sensors capturing meaningful signals from within a retail store environment. It is reflected by different kinds of sensors on the far left of the architecture diagram above.

## Gateway devices

Many IoT sensors can feed raw signals directly to the cloud or to a gateway device located near them. The gateway device performs data aggregation at the edge before sending summary insights to an IoT Central application. The gateway devices are also responsible for relaying command and control operations to the sensor devices when applicable.

## IoT Central application

The Azure IoT Central application ingests data from different kinds of IoT sensors and gateway devices within the retail store environment and generates a set of meaningful insights.

Azure IoT Central also provides a tailored experience to the store operator enabling them to remotely monitor and manage the infrastructure devices.

## Data transform

The Azure IoT Central application within a solution can be configured to export raw or aggregated insights to a set of Azure PaaS (Platform-as-a Service) services that can perform data manipulation and enrich these insights before landing them in a business application. 

## Business application

The IoT data can be used to power different kinds of business applications deployed within a retail environment. A retail store manager or staff member can use these applications to visualize business insights and take meaningful actions in real time. To learn how to build a real-time Power BI dashboard for your retail team, follow the [tutorial](./tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app.md).

1. Optionally, navigate to the **My Apps** view on the [Azure IoT Central application manager](https://aka.ms/iotcentral) website. The application tile displays the updated application image.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/customize-application-image.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Central customize application image.":::

### Create device templates

You can create device templates that enable you and the application operators to configure and manage devices. You can create a template by building a custom one, by importing an existing template file, or by importing a template from the Azure IoT device catalog. After you create and customize a device template, use it to connect real devices to your application. Optionally, use a device template to generate simulated devices for testing.

The **In-store analytics - checkout** application template has device templates for several devices.  There are device templates for two of the three devices you use in the application. The RuuviTag device template isn't included in the **In-store analytics - checkout** application template. In this section, you add a device template for RuuviTag sensors to your application.

To add a RuuviTag device template to your application:

1. Select **Device Templates** in the left pane.

1. Select **+ New** to create a new device template.

1. Find and select the **RuuviTag Multisensor** device template in the Azure IoT device catalog. 

1. Select **Next: Review**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/ruuvitag-device-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the Next: Customize button.":::

1. Select **Create**. The application adds the RuuviTag device template.

1. Select **Device templates** on the left pane. The page displays all device templates included in the application template, and the RuuviTag device template you just added.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/device-templates-list.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Central RuuviTag sensor device template.":::

### Customize device templates

You can customize the device templates in your application in three ways. First, you customize the native built-in interfaces in your devices by changing the device capabilities. For example, with a temperature sensor, you can change details such as the display name of the temperature interface, the data type, the units of measurement, and minimum and maximum operating ranges. 

Second, customize your device templates by adding cloud properties. Cloud properties aren't part of the built-in device capabilities. Cloud properties are custom data that your Azure IoT Central application creates, stores, and associates with your devices. An example of a cloud property could be a calculated value, or metadata such as a location that you want to associate with a set of devices.

Third, customize device templates by building custom views. Views provide a way for operators to visualize telemetry and metadata for your devices, such as device metrics and health.

Here, you use the first two methods to customize the device template for your RuuviTag sensors.

To customize the built-in interfaces of the RuuviTag device template:

1. Select **Device Templates** in the left pane. 

1. Select the template for RuuviTag sensors. 

1. Hide the left pane. The summary view of the template displays the device capabilities.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/ruuvitag-device-summary-view.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device template summary view.":::

1. Select **Customize** in the RuuviTag device template menu. 

1. Scroll in the list of capabilities and find the `RelativeHumidity` telemetry type. It's the row item with the editable **Display name** value of *RelativeHumidity*.

In the following steps, you customize the `RelativeHumidity` telemetry type for the RuuviTag sensors. Optionally, customize some of the other telemetry types.

For the `RelativeHumidity` telemetry type, make the following changes:

1. Select the **Expand** control to expand the schema details for the row.

1. Update the **Display Name** value from *RelativeHumidity* to a custom value such as *Humidity*.

1. Change the **Semantic Type** option from *Relative humidity* to *Humidity*.  Optionally, set schema values for the humidity telemetry type in the expanded schema view. Schema settings allow you to create detailed validation requirements for the data that your sensors track. For example, you could set minimum and maximum operating range values for a given interface.

1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/ruuvitag-device-template-customize.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Customize screen and highlights the Save button.":::

To add a cloud property to a device template in your application:

1. Select **Cloud Properties** in the RuuviTag device template menu.

1. Select **Add Cloud Property**. 

Specify the following values to create a custom property to store the location of each device:

1. Enter the value *Location* for the **Display Name**. This value is automatically copied to the **Name** field, which is a friendly name for the property. You can use the copied value or change it.

1. Select *String* in the **Schema** dropdown. A string type enables you to associate a location name string with any device based on the template. For instance, you could associate an area in a store with each device.

1. Set **Minimum Length** to *2*. 

1. Set **Trim Whitespace** to **On**.

1. Select **Save** to save your custom cloud property.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/ruuvitag-device-template-cloud-property.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Central RuuviTag device template customization.":::

1. Select **Publish**. 

    Publishing a device template makes it visible to application operators. After you've published a template, use it to generate simulated devices for testing, or to connect real devices to your application. If you already have devices connected to your application, publishing a customized template pushes the changes to the devices.

### Add devices

After you have created and customized device templates, it's time to add devices. 

For this tutorial, you use the following set of real and simulated devices to build the application:

- A real Rigado C500 gateway.
- Two real RuuviTag sensors.
- A simulated **Occupancy** sensor. The simulated sensor is included in the application template, so you don't need to create it. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have real devices, you can still complete this tutorial by creating simulated RuuviTag sensors. The following directions include steps to create a simulated RuuviTag. You don't need to create a simulated gateway.

Complete the steps in the following two articles to connect a real Rigado gateway and RuuviTag sensors. After you're done, return to this tutorial. Because you already created device templates in this tutorial, you don't need to create them again in the following set of directions.

- To connect a Rigado gateway, see [Connect a Rigado Cascade 500 to your Azure IoT Central application](../core/howto-connect-rigado-cascade-500.md).
- To connect RuuviTag sensors, see [Connect a RuuviTag sensor to your Azure IoT Central application](../core/howto-connect-ruuvi.md). You can also use these directions to create two simulated sensors, if needed.

### Add rules and actions

As part of using sensors in your Azure IoT Central application to monitor conditions, you can create rules to run actions when certain conditions are met. A rule is associated with a device template and one or more devices, and contains conditions that must be met based on device telemetry or events. A rule also has one or more associated actions. The actions may include sending email notifications, or triggering a webhook action to send data to other services. The **In-store analytics - checkout** application template includes some predefined rules for the devices in the application.

In this section, you create a new rule that checks the maximum relative humidity level based on the RuuviTag sensor telemetry. You add an action to the rule so that if the humidity exceeds the maximum, the application sends an email. 

To create a rule: 

1. Expand the left pane.

1. Select **Rules**.

1. Select **+ New**.

1. Enter *Humidity level* as the name of the rule. 

1. Choose the RuuviTag device template in **Target devices**. The rule you define will apply to all sensors based on that template. Optionally, you could create a filter that would apply the rule only to a defined subset of the sensors. 

1. Choose `Humidity` as the **Telemetry**. It's the device capability that you customized in a previous step.

1. Choose `Is greater than` as the **Operator**. 

1. Enter a typical upper range indoor humidity level for your environment as the **Value**. For example, enter *65*. You've set a condition for your rule that occurs when relative humidity in any RuuviTag real or simulated sensor exceeds this value. You may need to adjust the value up or down depending on the normal humidity range in your environment.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/rules-add-conditions.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Central add rule conditions.":::

To add an action to the rule:

1. Select **+ Email**.

1. Enter *High humidity notification* as the friendly **Display name** for the action. 

1. Enter the email address associated with your account in **To**. If you use a different email, the address you use must be for a user who has been added to the application. The user also needs to sign in and out at least once.

1. Optionally, enter a note to include in text of the email.

1. Select **Done** to complete the action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-in-store-analytics-create-app/rules-add-action.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Central add actions to rules.":::

1. Select **Save** to save and activate the new rule. 

    Within a few minutes, the specified email account should begin to receive emails. The application sends email each time a sensor indicates that the humidity level exceeded the value in your condition.
