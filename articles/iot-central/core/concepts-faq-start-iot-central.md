# Why should I start with IoT Central?

You should start your IoT journey with Azure IoT Central. Starting as high as possible in the Azure IoT technology stack lets you focus your time on using IoT data to create business value instead of simply getting your IoT data.

## Start with Azure IoT Central

An application platform as a service (aPaaS) streamlines many of the complex decisions you face when you build an IoT solution. Many IoT projects are de-funded because of early-stage requirements in simply getting IoT data. Use the capabilities and experiences in IoT Central to showcase the value of your IoT data without overburdening yourself with building the infrastructure for device connectivity and management.

## The power of Azure PaaS is orchestrated and managed for you

Azure IoT Central is an aPaaS offering that simplifies and accelerates IoT solution assembly and operation. It does this by pre-assembling platform as a service (PaaS) components into an extensible and fully managed app development platform hosted by Microsoft. IoT Central takes out much of the guesswork and complexity that's involved in building reliable, scalable, and secure IoT applications.

## Capabilities to accelerate time to value

An out-of-the box web UX and API surface area make it simple to monitor device conditions, create rules, and manage millions of devices and their data remotely throughout their life-cycles. Furthermore, IoT Central enables you to act on insights from your device data by extending IoT intelligence into line-of-business applications. This extensibility is provided through data export and APIs.

## Support for production deployment and operations

Building and operating cloud solutions comprised of numerous interconnected PaaS services requires expertise. That's why IoT Central also offers built-in disaster recovery, multitenancy, global availability, and a predictable cost structure.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned about starting with IoT Central a suggested next step is to do a [Quickstart](quick-deploy-iot-central.md), read the [overview](overview-iot-central.md), or explore the [architecture](concepts-architecture.md).
