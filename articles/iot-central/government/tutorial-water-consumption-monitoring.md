# Tutorial:  Deploy and walk through the water consumption monitoring application

Traditional water consumption tracking relies on water operators manually reading water consumption meters at the meter sites. More cities are replacing traditional meters with advanced smart meters enabling remote monitoring of consumption and remotely controlling valves to control water flow. Water consumption monitoring coupled with digital feedback message to the citizen can increase awareness and reduce water consumption.

The water consumption monitoring app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable water utilities and cities to remotely monitor and control water flow to reduce consumption.

Use the IoT Central *water consumption monitoring* application template and the guidance in this article to develop an end-to-end water consumption monitoring solution.

### Devices and connectivity

Water management solutions use smart water devices such as flow meters, water quality monitors, smart valves, leak detectors.

Devices in smart water solutions may connect through low-power wide area networks (LPWAN) or through a third-party network operator. For these types of devices, use the [Azure IoT Central Device Bridge](../core/howto-build-iotc-device-bridge.md) to send your device data to your IoT application in Azure IoT Central. You can also use an IP capable device gateway that connects directly to your IoT Central application.

### IoT Central

When you build an IoT solution, Azure IoT Central simplifies the build process and helps to reduce the burden and costs of IoT management, operations, and development. You can brand, customize, and integrate your solution with third-party services.

When you connect your smart water devices to IoT Central, the application provides device command and control, monitoring and alerting, a user interface with built-in RBAC, configurable dashboards, and extensibility options.

### Extensibility and integrations

You can extend your IoT application in IoT Central and optionally:

* Transform and integrate your IoT data for advanced analytics, for example training machine learning models, through continuous data export from IoT Central application.
* Automate workflows in other systems by triggering actions using Power Automate or webhooks from IoT Central application.
* Programmatically access your IoT application in IoT Central through IoT Central APIs.

### Business applications

You can use IoT data to power various business applications within a water utility. In your [IoT Central water consumption monitoring application](tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md) you can configure rules and actions, and set them to create alerts in [Connected Field Service](/dynamics365/field-service/connected-field-service). Configure Power Automate in IoT Central rules to automate workflows across applications and services. Additionally, based on service activities in Connected Field Service, information can be sent back to Azure IoT Central.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/iot-central-government-tab-overview1.png" alt-text="Application template":::

1. Select **Create app** under **Water consumption monitoring**.

To learn more, see [Create an IoT Central application](../core/howto-create-iot-central-application.md).

## Walk through the application

The following sections walk you through the key features of the application:

### Dashboard

After you create the application, the sample **Wide World water consumption dashboard** opens.
  
:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-dashboard-full.png" alt-text="Water consumption monitoring dashboard.":::


You can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators.

> [!NOTE]
> All data displayed on the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which you will explore in the next section.
  
The dashboard consists of different kinds of tiles:

* **Wide World Water Utility image tile**: The first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of the fictitious water utility Wide World Water. You can customize the tile by inserting your own image or removing it.
* **Average water flow KPI tile**: The KPI tile is configured to display as an example *the average in the last 30 minutes*. You can customize the KPI tile and set it to a different type and time range.
* **Device command tiles**: These tiles include the **Close valve**, **Open valve**, and **Set valve position** tiles. Selecting the commands takes you to the simulated device command page. In Azure IoT Central, a *command* is a *device capability* type. We'll explore this concept later in the [Device template](../government/tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md#explore-the-device-template) section of this tutorial.

* **Water distribution area map**: The map uses Azure Maps, which you can configure directly in Azure IoT Central. The map tile displays the device [location](../core/howto-use-location-data.md). Hover over the map and try the controls over the map, like *zoom in*, *zoom out*, or *expand*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-dashboard-map.png" alt-text="Water consumption monitoring dashboard map":::

* **Average water flow line chart** and **Environmental condition line chart**: You can visualize one or multiple device telemetries plotted as a line chart over a desired time range.
* **Average valve pressure heatmap chart**: You can choose the heatmap visualization type of device telemetry data you want to see distributed over a time range with a color index.
* **Reset alert thresholds content tile**: You can include call-to-action content tiles and embed a link to an action page. In this case, the reset alert threshold takes you to the application **Jobs**, where you can run updates to device properties. You'll explore this option later in the [Configure jobs](../government/tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md#configure-jobs) section of this tutorial.
* **Property tiles**: The dashboard displays **Valve operational info**, **Flow alert thresholds**, and **Maintenance info** tiles.

### Customize the dashboard

You can customize views in the dashboard for operators.

1. Select **Edit** to customize the **Wide World water consumption dashboard**. You can customize the dashboard by selecting the **Edit** menu. After the dashboard is in **edit** mode, you can add new tiles or you can configure it.
