# Manage Transparent Data Encryption in a Managed Instance using your own key from Azure Key Vault

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This Azure CLI script example configures Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with customer-managed key for Azure SQL Managed Instance, using a key from Azure Key Vault. This is often referred to as a Bring Your Own Key scenario for TDE. To learn more about the TDE with customer-managed key, see [TDE Bring Your Own Key to Azure SQL](../../../azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-byok-overview.md).

This sample requires an existing Managed Instance, see [Use Azure CLI to create an Azure SQL Managed Instance](create-configure-managed-instance-cli.md).
