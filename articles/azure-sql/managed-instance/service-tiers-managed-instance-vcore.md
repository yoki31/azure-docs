# vCore purchasing model - Azure SQL Managed Instance

This article reviews the [vCore purchasing model](../database/service-tiers-vcore.md) for [Azure SQL Managed Instance](sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md). 

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [vcore-overview](../includes/vcore-overview.md)]

The virtual core (vCore) purchasing model used by Azure SQL Managed Instance provides the following benefits: 

- Control over the hardware generation to better match the compute and memory requirements of the workload.
- Pricing discounts for [Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)](../azure-hybrid-benefit.md) and [Reserved Instance (RI)](../database/reserved-capacity-overview.md).
- Greater transparency in the hardware details that power compute, helping facilitate planning for migrations from on-premises deployments.
- Higher scaling granularity with multiple compute sizes available.


## <a id="compute-tiers"></a>Service tiers

Service tier options in the vCore purchasing model include General Purpose and Business Critical. The service tier generally defines the storage architecture, space and I/O limits, and business continuity options related to availability and disaster recovery. 

For more details, review [resource limits](resource-limits.md). 

|**Category**|**General Purpose**|**Business Critical**|
|---|---|---|
|**Best for**|Most business workloads. Offers budget-oriented, balanced, and scalable compute and storage options. |Offers business applications the highest resilience to failures by using several isolated replicas, and provides the highest I/O performance.|
|**Availability**|1 replica, no read-scale replicas|4 replicas total, 1 [read-scale replica](../database/read-scale-out.md),<br/> 2 high availability replicas (HA)|
|**Read-only replicas**| 0 built-in <br> 0 - 4 using [geo-replication](../database/active-geo-replication-overview.md) | 1 built-in, included in price <br> 0 - 4 using [geo-replication](../database/active-geo-replication-overview.md) |

### Choosing a service tier

For information on selecting a service tier for your particular workload, see the following articles:

- [When to choose the General Purpose service tier](../database/service-tier-general-purpose.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)
- [When to choose the Business Critical service tier](../database/service-tier-business-critical.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)

## Compute

SQL Managed Instance compute provides a specific amount of compute resources that are continuously provisioned independent of workload activity, and bills for the amount of compute provisioned at a fixed price per hour.

## Hardware generations

Hardware generation options in the vCore model include standard-series (Gen5), premium-series, and memory optimized premium-series hardware generations. The hardware generation generally defines the compute and memory limits and other characteristics that impact the performance of the workload.

For more information on the hardware generation specifics and limitations, see [Hardware generation characteristics](resource-limits.md#hardware-generation-characteristics).

In the [sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-user-db-resource-governor-azure-sql-database) dynamic management view, hardware generation for instances using Intel&reg; SP-8160 (Skylake) processors appears as Gen6, while hardware generation for instances using Intel&reg; 8272CL (Cascade Lake) appears as Gen7. The Intel&reg; 8370C (Ice Lake) CPUs used by premium-series and memory optimized premium-series hardware generations appear as Gen8. Resource limits for all standard-series (Gen5) instances are the same regardless of processor type (Broadwell, Skylake, or Cascade Lake).

### Selecting a hardware generation

In the Azure portal, you can select the hardware generation at the time of creation, or you can change the hardware generation of an existing SQL Managed Instance.

**To select a hardware generation when creating a SQL Managed Instance**

For detailed information, see [Create a SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/instance-create-quickstart.md).

On the **Basics** tab, select the **Configure database** link in the **Compute + storage** section, and then select desired hardware generation:

:::image type="content" source="../database/media/service-tiers-vcore/configure-managed-instance.png" alt-text="configure SQL Managed Instance"  loc-scope="azure-portal":::
  
**To change the hardware generation of an existing SQL Managed Instance**

#### [The Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

From the SQL Managed Instance page, select **Pricing tier** link placed under the Settings section

:::image type="content" source="../database/media/service-tiers-vcore/change-managed-instance-hardware.png" alt-text="change SQL Managed Instance hardware"  loc-scope="azure-portal":::

On the Pricing tier page, you will be able to change hardware generation as described in the previous steps.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the following PowerShell script:

```powershell-interactive
Set-AzSqlInstance -Name "managedinstance1" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" -ComputeGeneration Gen5
```

For more details, check [Set-AzSqlInstance](/powershell/module/az.sql/set-azsqlinstance) command.

#### [The Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the following CLI command:

```azurecli-interactive
az sql mi update -g mygroup -n myinstance --family Gen5
```

For more details, check [az sql mi update](/cli/azure/sql/mi#az_sql_mi_update) command.

### Hardware availability

#### <a id="gen4gen5-1"></a> Gen4

Gen4 hardware is [being phased out](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/gen-4-hardware-on-azure-sql-database-approaching-end-of-life-in-2020/) and is no longer available for new deployments. All new instances must be deployed on later hardware generations.

#### Standard-series (Gen5) and premium-series

Standard-series (Gen5) hardware is available in all public regions worldwide.
  
Premium-series and memory optimized premium-series hardware is in preview, and has limited regional availability. For more details, see [Azure SQL Managed Instance resource limits](../managed-instance/resource-limits.md#hardware-generation-characteristics).
