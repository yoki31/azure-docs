[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Azure SQL Database](../database/resource-limits-logical-server.md)
> * [Azure SQL Managed Instance](resource-limits.md)

This article provides an overview of the technical characteristics and resource limits for Azure SQL Managed Instance, and provides information about how to request an increase to these limits.

> [!NOTE]
> For differences in supported features and T-SQL statements see [Feature differences](../database/features-comparison.md) and [T-SQL statement support](transact-sql-tsql-differences-sql-server.md). For general differences between service tiers for Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance review [General Purpose](../database/service-tier-general-purpose.md) and [Business Critical](../database/service-tier-business-critical.md) service tiers. 

## Hardware generation characteristics

SQL Managed Instance has characteristics and resource limits that depend on the underlying infrastructure and architecture. SQL Managed Instance can be deployed on multiple hardware generations. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Gen5 hardware generation has been renamed to the **standard-series (Gen5)**, and we are introducing two new hardware generations in limited preview: **premium-series** and **memory optimized premium-series**.

For information on previous generation hardware generations, see [Previous generation hardware generation details](#previous-generation-hardware) later in this article. 

Hardware generations have different characteristics, as described in the following table:

|    | **Standard-series (Gen5)** | **Premium-series (preview)** | **Memory optimized premium-series (preview)** | 
|:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |
| **CPU** |  Intel&reg; E5-2673 v4 (Broadwell) 2.3 GHz, Intel&reg; SP-8160 (Skylake), and  Intel&reg; 8272CL (Cascade Lake) 2.5 GHz processors | Intel&reg; 8370C (Ice Lake) 2.8 GHz processors | Intel&reg; 8370C (Ice Lake) 2.8 GHz processors |
| **Number of vCores** <BR>vCore=1 LP (hyper-thread) | 4-80 vCores | 4-80 vCores | 4-64 vCores |
| **Max memory (memory/vCore ratio)** | 5.1 GB per vCore<br/>Add more vCores to get more memory. | 7 GB per vCore | 13.6 GB per vCore |
| **Max In-Memory OLTP memory** |  Instance limit: 0.8 - 1.65 GB per vCore | Instance limit: 1.1 - 2.3 GB per vCore | Instance limit: 2.2 - 4.5 GB per vCore |
| **Max instance reserved storage**\* | **General Purpose:** up to 16 TB<br/> **Business Critical:** up to 4 TB | **General Purpose:** up to 16 TB<br/> **Business Critical:** up to 5.5 TB | **General Purpose:** up to 16 TB <br/> **Business Critical:** up to 16 TB |

\* Dependent on [the number of vCores](#service-tier-characteristics).

>[!NOTE]
> If your business requires storage sizes greater than the available resource limits for Azure SQL Managed Instance, consider the Azure SQL Database [Hyperscale service tier](../database/service-tier-hyperscale.md).


### Regional support for premium-series hardware generations (preview)

| West US 3 | Yes | Yes | 

### In-memory OLTP available space 

The amount of in-memory OLTP space in [Business Critical](../database/service-tier-business-critical.md) service tier depends on the number of vCores and hardware generation. The following table lists the limits of memory that can be used for in-memory OLTP objects.

| **vCores** | **Standard-series (Gen5)** | **Premium-series** | **Memory optimized premium-series** | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| 4 vCores    | 3.14 GB | 4.39 GB | 8.79 GB | 
| 8 vCores    | 6.28 GB | 8.79 GB | 22.06 GB |  
| 16    vCores | 15.77 GB | 22.06 GB | 57.58 GB |
| 24    vCores | 25.25 GB | 35.34 GB | 93.09 GB |
| 32    vCores | 37.94 GB | 53.09 GB | 128.61 GB |
| 40    vCores | 52.23 GB | 73.09 GB | 164.13 GB |
| 64    vCores | 99.9 GB | 139.82 GB | 288.61 GB |
| 80    vCores | 131.68 GB| 184.30 GB | N/A |

## Service tier characteristics

SQL Managed Instance has two service tiers: [General Purpose](../database/service-tier-general-purpose.md) and [Business Critical](../database/service-tier-business-critical.md). 

> [!Important]
> The Business Critical service tier provides an additional built-in copy of the SQL Managed Instance (secondary replica) that can be used for read-only workload. If you can separate read-write queries and read-only/analytic/reporting queries, you are getting twice the vCores and memory for the same price. The secondary replica might lag a few seconds behind the primary instance, so it is designed to offload reporting/analytic workloads that don't need exact current state of data. In the table below, **read-only queries** are the queries that are executed on secondary replica.

| **Feature** | **General Purpose** | **Business Critical** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of vCores\* | 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64, 80 |  **Standard-series (Gen5)**: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64, 80 <BR> **Premium-series**: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64, 80 <BR> **Memory optimized premium-series**: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64<br/>\*Same number of vCores is dedicated for read-only queries. |

A few additional considerations: 

- **Currently available instance storage size** is the difference between reserved instance size and the used storage space.
- Both data and log file size in the user and system databases are included in the instance storage size that is compared with the max storage size limit. Use the [sys.master_files](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-master-files-transact-sql) system view to determine the total used space by databases. Error logs are not persisted and not included in the size. Backups are not included in storage size.
- Throughput and IOPS in the General Purpose tier also depend on the [file size](#file-io-characteristics-in-general-purpose-tier) that is not explicitly limited by the SQL Managed Instance.
  You can create another readable replica in a different Azure region using [auto-failover groups](../database/auto-failover-group-configure.md)
- Max instance IOPS depend on the file layout and distribution of workload. As an example, if you create 7 x 1 TB files with max 5 K IOPS each and seven small files (smaller than 128 GB) with 500 IOPS each, you can get 38500 IOPS per instance (7x5000+7x500) if your workload can use all files. Note that some IOPS are also used for auto-backups.

Find more information about the [resource limits in SQL Managed Instance pools in this article](instance-pools-overview.md#resource-limitations).

### Data and log storage

The following factors affect the amount of storage used for data and log files, and apply to General Purpose and Business Critical tiers. 

- Each compute size supports a maximum data size, with a default of 16 GB. For more information on resource limits in Azure SQL Managed Instance, see [resource-limits.md].
- When you configure maximum data size, an additional 30 percent of storage is automatically added for log files.
- You can select any maximum data size between 1 GB and the supported storage size maximum, in 1 GB increments.
- In the General Purpose service tier, `tempdb` uses local SSD storage, and this storage cost is included in the vCore price.
- In the Business Critical service tier, `tempdb` shares local SSD storage with data and log files, and `tempdb` storage cost is included in the vCore price.
- The maximum storage size for a SQL Managed Instance must be specified in multiples of 32 GB.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the General Purpose and Business Critical tiers, you are charged for the maximum storage size configured for a managed instance. 

To monitor total consumed instance storage size for SQL Managed Instance, use the *storage_space_used_mb* [metric](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftsqlmanagedinstances). To monitor the current allocated and used storage size of individual data and log files in a database using T-SQL, use the [sys.database_files](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-database-files-transact-sql) view and the [FILEPROPERTY(... , 'SpaceUsed')](/sql/t-sql/functions/fileproperty-transact-sql) function.

> [!TIP]
> Under some circumstances, you may need to shrink a database to reclaim unused space. For more information, see [Manage file space in Azure SQL Database](../database/file-space-manage.md).

### Backups and storage

Storage for database backups is allocated to support the [point-in-time restore (PITR)](../database/recovery-using-backups.md) and [long-term retention (LTR)](../database/long-term-retention-overview.md) capabilities of SQL Managed Instance. This storage is separate from data and log file storage, and is billed separately.

- **PITR**: In General Purpose and Business Critical tiers, individual database backups are copied to [read-access geo-redundant (RA-GRS) storage](../../storage/common/geo-redundant-design.md) automatically. The storage size increases dynamically as new backups are created. The storage is used by full, differential, and transaction log backups. The storage consumption depends on the rate of change of the database and the retention period configured for backups. You can configure a separate retention period for each database between  0 to 35 days for SQL Managed Instance. A backup storage amount equal to the configured maximum data size is provided at no extra charge.
- **LTR**: You also have the option to configure long-term retention of full backups for up to 10 years. If you set up an LTR policy, these backups are stored in RA-GRS storage automatically, but you can control how often the backups are copied. To meet different compliance requirements, you can select different retention periods for weekly, monthly, and/or yearly backups. The configuration you choose determines how much storage will be used for LTR backups. For more information, see [Long-term backup retention](../database/long-term-retention-overview.md).

### File IO characteristics in General Purpose tier

In the General Purpose service tier, every database file gets dedicated IOPS and throughput that depend on the file size. Larger files get more IOPS and throughput. IO characteristics of database files are shown in the following table:

| **File size** | **>=0 and <=128 GiB** | **>128 and <= 512 GiB** | **>0.5 and <=1 TiB**    | **>1 and <=2 TiB**    | **>2 and <=4 TiB** | **>4 and <=8 TiB** | **>8 and <=16 TiB** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| IOPS per file       | 500   | 2300              | 5000  | 7500              | 7500              | 12,500   | |
| Throughput per file | 100 MiB/s | 150 MiB/s | 200 MiB/s | 250 MiB/s| 250 MiB/s | 480 MiB/s |  |

If you notice high IO latency on some database file or you see that IOPS/throughput is reaching the limit, you might improve performance by [increasing the file size](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-SQL-Database/Increase-data-file-size-to-improve-HammerDB-workload-performance/ba-p/823337).

There is also an instance-level limit on the max log write throughput (see above for values, e.g.,  22 MB/s), so you may not be able to reach the max file throughout on the log file because you are hitting the instance throughput limit.

## Supported regions

SQL Managed Instance can be created only in [supported regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=sql-database&regions=all). To create a SQL Managed Instance in a region that is currently not supported, you can [send a support request via the Azure portal](../database/quota-increase-request.md).

## Supported subscription types

SQL Managed Instance currently supports deployment only on the following types of subscriptions:

- [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/)
- [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/)
- [Cloud Service Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/csp-documents-and-learning-resources)
- [Enterprise Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0148p/)
- [Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0023p/)
- [Subscriptions with monthly Azure credit for Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/)

## Regional resource limitations

> [!Note]
> For the latest information on region availability for subscriptions, first check [select a region](../capacity-errors-troubleshoot.md).

Supported subscription types can contain a limited number of resources per region. SQL Managed Instance has two default limits per Azure region (that can be increased on-demand by creating a special [support request in the Azure portal](../database/quota-increase-request.md) depending on a type of subscription type:

- **Subnet limit**: The maximum number of subnets where instances of SQL Managed Instance are deployed in a single region.
- **vCore unit limit**: The maximum number of vCore units that can be deployed across all instances in a single region. One GP vCore uses one vCore unit and one BC vCore takes four vCore units. The total number of instances is not limited as long as it is within the vCore unit limit.

> [!Note]
> These limits are default settings and not technical limitations. The limits can be increased on-demand by creating a special [support request in the Azure portal](../database/quota-increase-request.md) if you need more instances in the current region. As an alternative, you can create new instances of SQL Managed Instance in another Azure region without sending support requests.

The following table shows the **default regional limits** for supported subscription types (default limits can be extended using support request described below):

|Subscription type| Max number of SQL Managed Instance subnets | Max number of vCore units* |
| :---| :--- | :--- |
|CSP |16 (30 in some regions**)|960 (1440 in some regions**)|
|EA|16 (30 in some regions**)|960 (1440 in some regions**)|
|Enterprise Dev/Test|6|320|
|Pay-as-you-go|6|320|
|Pay-as-you-go Dev/Test|6|320|
|Azure Pass|3|64|
|BizSpark|3|64|
|BizSpark Plus|3|64|
|Microsoft Azure Sponsorship|3|64|
|Microsoft Partner Network|3|64|
|Visual Studio Enterprise (MPN)|3|64|
|Visual Studio Enterprise|3|32|
|Visual Studio Enterprise (BizSpark)|3|32|
|Visual Studio Professional|3|32|
|MSDN Platforms|3|32|

\* In planning deployments, please take into consideration that Business Critical (BC) service tier requires four (4) times more vCore capacity than General Purpose (GP) service tier. For example: 1 GP vCore = 1 vCore unit and 1 BC vCore = 4 vCore. To simplify your consumption analysis against the default limits, summarize the vCore units across all subnets in the region where SQL Managed Instance is deployed and compare the results with the instance unit limits for your subscription type. **Max number of vCore units** limit applies to each subscription in a region. There is no limit per individual subnets except that the sum of all vCores deployed across multiple subnets must be lower or equal to **max number of vCore units**.

\*\* Larger subnet and vCore limits are available in the following regions: Australia East, East US, East US 2, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, UK South, West Europe, West US 2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In case your vCore and subnet limit is 0, it means that default regional limit for your subscription type is not set. You can also use quota increase request for getting subscription access in specific region following the same procedure - providing required vCore and subnet values.

## Request a quota increase

If you need more instances in your current regions, send a support request to extend the quota using the Azure portal. For more information, see [Request quota increases for Azure SQL Database](../database/quota-increase-request.md).

## Previous generation hardware

This section includes details on previous generation hardware generations. Consider [moving your instance of SQL Managed Instance to the standard-series (Gen5)](../database/service-tiers-vcore.md) hardware to experience a wider range of vCore and storage scalability, accelerated networking, best IO performance, and minimal latency.

- Gen4 is being phased out and is not available for new deployments. 

### Hardware generation characteristics

|   | **Gen4** |

### In-memory OLTP available space 

The amount of In-memory OLTP space in [Business Critical](../database/service-tier-business-critical.md) service tier depends on the number of vCores and hardware generation. The following table lists limits of memory that can be used for In-memory OLTP objects.

| In-memory OLTP space    |  **Gen4** |
