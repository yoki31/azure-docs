# vCore purchasing model - Azure SQL Database

> * [Azure SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/service-tiers-managed-instance-vcore.md)

This article reviews the [vCore purchasing model](service-tiers-vcore.md) for [Azure SQL Database](sql-database-paas-overview.md). For help choosing between the vCore and DTU purchasing models, see the [differences between the vCore and DTU purchasing models](purchasing-models.md).

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [vcore-overview](../includes/vcore-overview.md)]

The vCore purchasing model used by Azure SQL Database provides several benefits over the DTU purchasing model:

- Higher compute, memory, I/O, and storage limits.
- Control over the hardware generation to better match compute and memory requirements of the workload.
- Pricing discounts for [Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)](../azure-hybrid-benefit.md).
- Greater transparency in the hardware details that power the compute, that facilitates planning for migrations from on-premises deployments.
- [Reserved instance pricing](reserved-capacity-overview.md) is only available for vCore purchasing model. 
- Higher scaling granularity with multiple compute sizes available.


## Service tiers

Service tier options in the vCore purchasing model include General Purpose, Business Critical, and Hyperscale. The service tier generally service tier defines hardware, storage type and IOPS, high availability and disaster recovery options, and other features like memory-optimized object types.

For greater details, review resource limits for [logical server](resource-limits-logical-server.md), [single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md), and [pooled databases](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md). 

|**Use case**|**General Purpose**|**Business Critical**|**Hyperscale**|

### Choosing a service tier

For information on selecting a service tier for your particular workload, see the following articles:

- [When to choose the General Purpose service tier](service-tier-general-purpose.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)
- [When to choose the Business Critical service tier](service-tier-business-critical.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)
- [When to choose the Hyperscale service tier](service-tier-hyperscale.md#who-should-consider-the-hyperscale-service-tier)

## Resource limits

For vCore resource limits, see [logical servers](resource-limits-logical-server.md), [single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md), [pooled databases](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md). 

## Compute tiers

Compute tier options in the vCore model include the provisioned and [serverless](serverless-tier-overview.md) compute tiers.

- While the **provisioned compute tier** provides a specific amount of compute resources that are continuously provisioned independent of workload activity, the **serverless compute tier** auto-scales compute resources based on workload activity. 
- While the **provisioned compute tier** bills for the amount of compute provisioned at a fixed price per hour, the **serverless compute tier** bills for the amount of compute used, per second.


## Hardware generations

Hardware generation options in the vCore model include Gen 4/5, M-series, Fsv2-series, and DC-series. The hardware generation generally defines the compute and memory limits and other characteristics that impact the performance of the workload.

### Gen4/Gen5

- Gen4/Gen5 hardware provides balanced compute and memory resources, and is suitable for most database workloads that do not have higher memory, higher vCore, or faster single vCore requirements as provided by Fsv2-series or M-series.

For regions where Gen4/Gen5 is available, see [Gen4/Gen5 availability](#gen4gen5-1).

### Fsv2-series

- Fsv2-series is a compute optimized hardware option delivering low CPU latency and high clock speed for the most CPU demanding workloads.
- Depending on the workload, Fsv2-series can deliver more CPU performance per vCore than Gen5, and the 72 vCore size can provide more CPU performance for less cost than 80 vCores on Gen5. 
- Fsv2 provides less memory and tempdb per vCore than other hardware so workloads sensitive to those limits may want to consider Gen5 or M-series instead.  

Fsv2-series in only supported in the General Purpose tier. For regions where Fsv2-series is available, see [Fsv2-series availability](#fsv2-series-1).

### M-series

- M-series is a memory optimized hardware option for workloads demanding more memory and higher compute limits than provided by Gen5.
- M-series provides 29 GB per vCore and up to 128 vCores, which increases the memory limit relative to Gen5 by 8x to nearly 4 TB.

M-series is only supported in the Business Critical tier and does not support zone redundancy.  For regions where M-series is available, see [M-series availability](#m-series-1).

#### Azure offer types supported by M-series

To access M-series, the subscription must be a paid offer type including Pay-As-You-Go or Enterprise Agreement (EA).  For a complete list of Azure offer types supported by M-series, see [current offers without spending limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details).

<!--
To enable M-series hardware for a subscription and region, a support request must be opened. The subscription must be a paid offer type including Pay-As-You-Go or Enterprise Agreement (EA).  If the support request is approved, then the selection and provisioning experience of M-series follows the same pattern as for other hardware generations. For regions where M-series is available, see [M-series availability](#m-series).
-->

### DC-series

- DC-series hardware uses Intel processors with Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) technology.
- DC-series is required for [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves), which is not supported with other hardware configurations.
- DC-series is designed for workloads that process sensitive data and demand confidential query processing capabilities, provided by Always Encrypted with secure enclaves.
- DC-series hardware provides balanced compute and memory resources.

DC-series is only supported for the Provisioned compute (Serverless is not supported) and it does not support zone redundancy. For regions where DC-series is available, see [DC-series availability](#dc-series-1).

#### Azure offer types supported by DC-series

To access DC-series, the subscription must be a paid offer type including Pay-As-You-Go or Enterprise Agreement (EA).  For a complete list of Azure offer types supported by DC-series, see [current offers without spending limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details).


### Selecting a hardware generation

In the Azure portal, you can select the hardware generation for a database or pool in SQL Database at the time of creation, or you can change the hardware generation of an existing database or pool.

**To select a hardware generation when creating a SQL Database or pool**

For detailed information, see [Create a SQL Database](single-database-create-quickstart.md).

On the **Basics** tab, select the **Configure database** link in the **Compute + storage** section, and then select the **Change configuration** link:

:::image type="content" source="./media/service-tiers-vcore/configure-sql-database.png" alt-text="configure SQL database" loc-scope="azure-portal":::

Select the desired hardware generation:

:::image type="content" source="./media/service-tiers-vcore/select-hardware.png" alt-text="select hardware for SQL database" loc-scope="azure-portal":::

**To change the hardware generation of an existing SQL Database or pool**

For a database, on the Overview page, select the **Pricing tier** link:

:::image type="content" source="./media/service-tiers-vcore/change-hardware.png" alt-text="change hardware for SQL Database" loc-scope="azure-portal":::

For a pool, on the Overview page, select **Configure**.

Follow the steps to change configuration, and select the hardware generation as described in the previous steps.
