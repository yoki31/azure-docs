This article provides an overview of resource management in Azure SQL Database. It provides information on what happens when resource limits are reached, and describes  resource governance mechanisms that are used to enforce these limits.

For specific resource limits per pricing tier (also known as service objective) for single databases, refer to either [DTU-based single database resource limits](resource-limits-dtu-single-databases.md) or [vCore-based single database resource limits](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md). For elastic pool resource limits, refer to either [DTU-based elastic pool resource limits](resource-limits-dtu-elastic-pools.md) or [vCore-based elastic pool resource limits](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md).

> [!TIP]
> For Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool limits, see [capacity limits](../../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-service-capacity-limits.md) and [memory and concurrency limits](../../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/memory-concurrency-limits.md).

## Logical server limits

| Resource | Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Databases per [logical server](logical-servers.md) | 5000 |
| Default number of logical servers per subscription in a region | 20 |
| Max number of logical servers per subscription in a region | 250 |
| DTU / eDTU quota per logical server | 54,000 |
| vCore quota per logical server | 540 |
| Max elastic pools per logical server | Limited by number of DTUs or vCores. For example, if each pool is 1000 DTUs, then a server can support 54 pools.|
|||

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the number of databases approaches the limit per logical server, the following can occur:
>
> - Increasing latency in running queries against the master database. This includes views of resource utilization statistics such as `sys.resource_stats`.
> - Increasing latency in management operations and rendering portal viewpoints that involve enumerating databases in the server.

> [!NOTE]
> To obtain more DTU/eDTU quota, vCore quota, or more logical servers than the default number, submit a new support request in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Request quota increases for Azure SQL Database](quota-increase-request.md).

## What happens when resource limits are reached

### Compute CPU

When database compute CPU utilization becomes high, query latency increases, and queries can even time out. Under these conditions, queries may be queued by the service and are provided resources for execution as resources become free.
When encountering high compute utilization, mitigation options include:

- Increasing the compute size of the database or elastic pool to provide the database with more compute resources. See [Scale single database resources](single-database-scale.md) and [Scale elastic pool resources](elastic-pool-scale.md).
- Optimizing queries to reduce CPU resource utilization of each query. For more information, see [Query Tuning/Hinting](performance-guidance.md#query-tuning-and-hinting).

### Storage

When database space used reaches the maximum data size limit, database inserts and updates that increase data size fail and clients receive an [error message](troubleshoot-common-errors-issues.md). SELECT and DELETE statements remain unaffected.

In Premium and Business Critical service tiers, clients also receive an error message if combined storage consumption by data, transaction log, and tempdb exceeds maximum local storage size. For more information, see [Storage space governance](#storage-space-governance).

When encountering high space utilization, mitigation options include:

- Increase maximum data size of the database or elastic pool, or scale up to a service objective with a higher maximum data size limit. See [Scale single database resources](single-database-scale.md) and [Scale elastic pool resources](elastic-pool-scale.md).
- If the database is in an elastic pool, then alternatively the database can be moved outside of the pool so that its storage space isn't shared with other databases.
- Shrink a database to reclaim unused space. In elastic pools, shrinking a database provides more storage for other databases in the pool. For more information, see [Manage file space in Azure SQL Database](file-space-manage.md).
- Check if high space utilization is due to a spike in the size of Persistent Version Store (PVS). PVS is a part of each database, and is used to implement  [Accelerated Database Recovery](../accelerated-database-recovery.md). To determine current PVS size, see [PVS troubleshooting](/sql/relational-databases/accelerated-database-recovery-management#troubleshooting). A common reason for large PVS size is a transaction that is open for a long time (hours), preventing cleanup of older versions in PVS.
- For large databases in Premium and Business Critical service tiers, you may receive an out-of-space error even though used space in the database is below its maximum data size limit. This may happen if tempdb or transaction log consume a large amount of storage toward the maximum local storage limit. [Fail over](high-availability-sla.md#testing-application-fault-resiliency) the database or elastic pool to reset tempdb to its initial smaller size, or [shrink](file-space-manage.md#shrinking-transaction-log-file) transaction log to reduce local storage consumption.
### Sessions, workers, and requests

Sessions, workers, and requests are defined as follows:

- A session represents a process connected to the database engine.
- A request is the logical representation of a query or batch. A request is issued by a client connected to a session. Over time, multiple requests may be issued on the same session.
- A worker thread, also known as a worker or thread, is a logical representation of an operating system thread. A request may have many workers when executed with a parallel query execution plan, or a single worker when executed with a serial (single threaded) execution plan. Workers are also required to support activities outside of requests: for example, a worker is required to process a login request as a session connects.

The maximum numbers of sessions and workers are determined by the service tier and compute size. New requests are rejected when session or worker limits are reached, and clients receive an error message. While the number of connections available can be controlled by the application, the number of concurrent workers is often harder to estimate and control. This is especially true during peak load periods when database resource limits are reached and workers pile up due to longer running queries, large blocking chains, or excessive query parallelism.

> [!NOTE]
> The initial offering of Azure SQL Database supported only single threaded queries. At that time, the number of requests was always equivalent to the number of workers. Error message 10928 in Azure SQL Database contains the wording "The request limit for the database is *N* and has been reached" for backwards compatibility purposes.  The limit reached is actually the number of workers. If your max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP) setting is equal to zero or is greater than one, the number of workers may be much higher than the number of requests, and the limit may be reached much sooner than when MAXDOP is equal to one. Learn more about error 10928 in [Resource governance errors](troubleshoot-common-errors-issues.md#resource-governance-errors).

You can mitigate approaching or hitting worker or session limits by:

- Increasing the service tier or compute size of the database or elastic pool. See [Scale single database resources](single-database-scale.md) and [Scale elastic pool resources](elastic-pool-scale.md).
- Optimizing queries to reduce resource utilization if the cause of increased workers is contention for compute resources. For more information, see [Query Tuning/Hinting](performance-guidance.md#query-tuning-and-hinting).
- Optimizing the query workload to reduce the number of occurrences and duration of query blocking. For more information, see [Understand and resolve Azure SQL blocking problems](understand-resolve-blocking.md).
- Reducing the [MAXDOP](configure-max-degree-of-parallelism.md) setting when appropriate.

### Memory

Unlike other resources (CPU, workers, storage), reaching the memory limit does not negatively impact query performance, and does not cause errors and failures. As described in detail in [Memory Management Architecture Guide](/sql/relational-databases/memory-management-architecture-guide), the database engine often uses all available memory, by design. Memory is used primarily for caching data, to avoid slower storage access. Thus, higher memory utilization usually improves query performance due to faster reads from memory, rather than slower reads from storage.

After database engine startup, as the workload starts reading data from storage, the database engine aggressively caches data in memory. After this initial ramp-up period, it is common and expected to see the `avg_memory_usage_percent` and `avg_instance_memory_percent` columns in [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) to be close or equal to 100%, particularly for databases that are not idle, and do not fully fit in memory.

Besides the data cache, memory is used in other components of the database engine. When there is demand for memory and all available memory has been used by the data cache, the database engine will dynamically reduce data cache size to make memory available to other components, and will dynamically grow data cache when other components release memory.

In rare cases, a sufficiently demanding workload may cause an insufficient memory condition, leading to out-of-memory errors. This can happen at any level of memory utilization between 0% and 100%. This is more likely to occur on smaller compute sizes that have proportionally smaller memory limits, and/or with workloads using more memory for query processing, such as in [dense elastic pools](elastic-pool-resource-management.md).

When encountering out-of-memory errors, mitigation options include:
- Increasing the service tier or compute size of the database or elastic pool. See [Scale single database resources](single-database-scale.md) and [Scale elastic pool resources](elastic-pool-scale.md).
- Optimizing queries and configuration to reduce memory utilization. Common solutions are described in the following table.

|Solution|Description|
| :----- | :----- |
|Reduce the size of memory grants|For more information about memory grants, see the [Understanding SQL Server memory grant](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server/understanding-sql-server-memory-grant/ba-p/383595) blog post. A common solution for avoiding excessively large memory grants is keeping [statistics](/sql/relational-databases/statistics/statistics) up to date. This results in more accurate estimates of memory consumption by the query engine, avoiding unnecessarily large memory grants.</br></br>In databases using compatibility level 140 and above, the database engine may automatically adjust memory grant size using [Batch mode memory grant feedback](/sql/relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing#batch-mode-memory-grant-feedback). In databases using compatibility level 150 and above, the database engine similarly uses [Row mode memory grant feedback](/sql/relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing#row-mode-memory-grant-feedback), for more common row mode queries. This built-in functionality helps avoid out-of-memory errors due to unnecessarily large memory grants.|
|Reduce the size of query plan cache|The database engine caches query plans in memory, to avoid compiling a query plan for every query execution. To avoid query plan cache bloat caused by caching plans that are only used once, enable the OPTIMIZE_FOR_AD_HOC_WORKLOADS [database-scoped configuration](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql).|
|Reduce the size of lock memory|The database engine uses memory for [locks](/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide#Lock_Engine). When possible, avoid large transactions that may acquire a large number of locks and cause high lock memory consumption.|

## Resource consumption by user workloads and internal processes

Azure SQL Database requires compute resources to implement core service features such as high availability and disaster recovery, database backup and restore, monitoring, Query Store, Automatic tuning, etc. The system sets aside a certain limited portion of the overall resources for these internal processes using [resource governance](#resource-governance) mechanisms, making the remainder of resources available for user workloads. At times when internal processes aren't using compute resources, the system makes them available to user workloads.

Total CPU and memory consumption by user workloads and internal processes is reported in the [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) and [sys.resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) views, in `avg_instance_cpu_percent` and `avg_instance_memory_percent` columns. This data is also reported via the `sqlserver_process_core_percent` and `sqlserver_process_memory_percent` Azure Monitor metrics, for [single databases](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftsqlserversdatabases) and [elastic pools](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftsqlserverselasticpools) at the pool level.

CPU and memory consumption by user workloads in each database is reported in the [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) and [sys.resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) views, in `avg_cpu_percent` and `avg_memory_usage_percent` columns. For elastic pools, pool-level resource consumption is reported in the [sys.elastic_pool_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-elastic-pool-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) view. User workload CPU consumption is also reported via the `cpu_percent` Azure Monitor metric, for [single databases](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftsqlserversdatabases) and [elastic pools](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftsqlserverselasticpools) at the pool level.

A more detailed breakdown of recent resource consumption by user workloads and internal processes is reported in the [sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools_history_ex](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-resource-pools-history-ex-azure-sql-database) and [sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups_history_ex](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-workload-groups-history-ex-azure-sql-database) views. For details on resource pools and workload groups referenced in these views, see [Resource governance](#resource-governance). These views report on resource utilization by user workloads and specific internal processes in the associated resource pools and workload groups.

In the context of performance monitoring and troubleshooting, it's important to consider both **user CPU consumption** (`avg_cpu_percent`, `cpu_percent`), and **total CPU consumption** by user workloads and internal processes (`avg_instance_cpu_percent`,`sqlserver_process_core_percent`).

**User CPU consumption** is calculated as a percentage of the user workload limits in each service objective. **User CPU utilization** at 100% indicates that the user workload has reached the limit of the service objective. However, when **total CPU consumption** reaches the 70-100% range, it's possible to see user workload throughput flattening out and query latency increasing, even if reported **user CPU consumption** remains significantly below 100%. This is more likely to occur when using smaller service objectives with a moderate allocation of compute resources, but relatively intense user workloads, such as in [dense elastic pools](elastic-pool-resource-management.md). This can also occur with smaller service objectives when internal processes temporarily require additional resources, for example when creating a new replica of the database, or backing up the database.

When **total CPU consumption** is high, mitigation options are the same as noted in the [Compute CPU](#compute-cpu) section, and include service objective increase and/or user workload optimization.

## Resource governance

To enforce resource limits, Azure SQL Database uses a resource governance implementation that is based on SQL Server [Resource Governor](/sql/relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor), modified and extended to run in the cloud. In SQL Database, multiple [resource pools](/sql/relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-resource-pool) and [workload groups](/sql/relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-workload-group), with resource limits set at both pool and group levels, provide a [balanced Database-as-a-Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resource-governance-in-azure-sql-database/). User workload and internal workloads are classified into separate resource pools and workload groups. User workload on the primary and readable secondary replicas, including geo-replicas, is classified into the `SloSharedPool1` resource pool and `UserPrimaryGroup.DBId[N]` workload groups, where `[N]` stands for the database ID value. In addition, there are multiple resource pools and workload groups for various internal workloads.

In addition to using Resource Governor to govern resources within the database engine, Azure SQL Database also uses Windows [Job Objects](/windows/win32/procthread/job-objects) for process level resource governance, and Windows [File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)](/windows-server/storage/fsrm/fsrm-overview) for storage quota management.

Azure SQL Database resource governance is hierarchical in nature. From top to bottom, limits are enforced at the OS level and at the storage volume level using operating system resource governance mechanisms and Resource Governor, then at the resource pool level using Resource Governor, and then at the workload group level using Resource Governor. Resource governance limits in effect for the current database or elastic pool are reported in the [sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-user-db-resource-governor-azure-sql-database) view.

### Data IO governance

Data IO governance is a process in Azure SQL Database used to limit both read and write physical IO against data files of a database. IOPS limits are set for each service level to minimize the "noisy neighbor" effect, to provide resource allocation fairness in a multi-tenant service, and to stay within the capabilities of the underlying hardware and storage.

For single databases, workload group limits are applied to all storage IO against the database. For elastic pools, workload group limits apply to each database in the pool. Additionally, the resource pool limit additionally applies to the cumulative IO of the elastic pool. Tempdb IO is subject to workload group limits, with the exception of Basic, Standard, and General Purpose service tier, where higher tempdb IO limits apply. In general, resource pool limits may not be achievable by the workload against a database (either single or pooled), because workload group limits are lower than resource pool limits and limit IOPS/throughput sooner. However, pool limits may be reached by the combined workload against multiple databases in the same pool.

For example, if a query generates 1000 IOPS without any IO resource governance, but the workload group maximum IOPS limit is set to 900 IOPS, the query won't be able to generate more than 900 IOPS. However, if the resource pool maximum IOPS limit is set to 1500 IOPS, and the total IO from all workload groups associated with the resource pool exceeds 1500 IOPS, then the IO of the same query may be reduced below the workgroup limit of 900 IOPS.

The IOPS and throughput max values returned by the [sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-user-db-resource-governor-azure-sql-database) view act as limits/caps, not as guarantees. Further, resource governance doesn't guarantee any specific storage latency. The best achievable latency, IOPS, and throughput for a given user workload depend not only on IO resource governance limits, but also on the mix of IO sizes used, and on the capabilities of the underlying storage. SQL Database uses IOs that vary in size between 512 KB and 4 MB. For the purposes of enforcing IOPS limits, every IO is accounted regardless of its size, with the exception of databases with data files in Azure Storage. In that case, IOs larger than 256 KB are accounted as multiple 256-KB IOs, to align with Azure Storage IO accounting.

For Basic, Standard, and General Purpose databases, which use data files in Azure Storage, the `primary_group_max_io` value may not be achievable if a database doesn't have enough data files to cumulatively provide this number of IOPS, or if data isn't distributed evenly across files, or if the performance tier of underlying blobs limits IOPS/throughput below the resource governance limits. Similarly, with small log IOs generated by frequent transaction commits, the `primary_max_log_rate` value may not be achievable by a workload due to the IOPS limit on the underlying Azure Storage blob. For databases using Azure Premium Storage, Azure SQL Database uses sufficiently large storage blobs to obtain needed IOPS/throughput, regardless of database size. For larger databases, multiple data files are created to increase total IOPS/throughput capacity.

Resource utilization values such as `avg_data_io_percent` and `avg_log_write_percent`, reported in the [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database),  [sys.resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-resource-stats-azure-sql-database), and [sys.elastic_pool_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-elastic-pool-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) views, are calculated as percentages of maximum resource governance limits. Therefore, when factors other than resource governance limit IOPS/throughput, it's possible to see IOPS/throughput flattening out and latencies increasing as the workload increases, even though reported resource utilization remains below 100%.

To determine read and write IOPS, throughput, and latency per database file, use the [sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats()](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-io-virtual-file-stats-transact-sql) function. This function surfaces all IO against the database, including background IO that isn't accounted towards `avg_data_io_percent`, but uses IOPS and throughput of the underlying storage, and can impact observed storage latency. The function reports additional latency that may be introduced by IO resource governance for reads and writes, in the `io_stall_queued_read_ms` and `io_stall_queued_write_ms` columns respectively.

### Transaction log rate governance

Transaction log rate governance is a process in Azure SQL Database used to limit high ingestion rates for workloads such as bulk insert, SELECT INTO, and index builds. These limits are tracked and enforced at the subsecond level to the rate of log record generation, limiting throughput regardless of how many IOs may be issued against data files. Transaction log generation rates currently scale linearly up to a point that is hardware-dependent and service tier-dependent.

Log rates are set such that they can be achieved and sustained in a variety of scenarios, while the overall system can maintain its functionality with minimized impact to the user load. Log rate governance ensures that transaction log backups stay within published recoverability SLAs. This governance also prevents an excessive backlog on secondary replicas, that could otherwise lead to longer than expected downtime during failovers.

The actual physical IOs to transaction log files are not governed or limited. As log records are generated, each operation is evaluated and assessed for whether it should be delayed in order to maintain a maximum desired log rate (MB/s per second). The delays aren't added when the log records are flushed to storage, rather log rate governance is applied during log rate generation itself.

The actual log generation rates imposed at run time may also be influenced by feedback mechanisms, temporarily reducing the allowable log rates so the system can stabilize. Log file space management, avoiding running into out of log space conditions and data replication mechanisms can temporarily decrease the overall system limits.

Log rate governor traffic shaping is surfaced via the following wait types (exposed in the [sys.dm_exec_requests](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-requests-transact-sql) and [sys.dm_os_wait_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql) views):

| Wait Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| LOG_RATE_GOVERNOR | Database limiting |
| POOL_LOG_RATE_GOVERNOR | Pool limiting |
| INSTANCE_LOG_RATE_GOVERNOR | Instance level limiting |  
| HADR_THROTTLE_LOG_RATE_SEND_RECV_QUEUE_SIZE | Feedback control, availability group physical replication in Premium/Business Critical not keeping up |  
| HADR_THROTTLE_LOG_RATE_LOG_SIZE | Feedback control, limiting rates to avoid an out of log space condition |
| HADR_THROTTLE_LOG_RATE_MISMATCHED_SLO | Geo-replication feedback control, limiting log rate to avoid high data latency and unavailability of geo-secondaries|
|||

When encountering a log rate limit that is hampering desired scalability, consider the following options:

- Scale up to a higher service level in order to get the maximum log rate of a service tier, or switch to a different service tier. The [Hyperscale](service-tier-hyperscale.md) service tier provides 100 MB/s log rate regardless of chosen service level.
- If data being loaded is transient, such as staging data in an ETL process, it can be loaded into tempdb (which is minimally logged).
- For analytic scenarios, load into a clustered [columnstore](/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview) table, or a table with indexes that use [data compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression). This reduces the required log rate. This technique does increase CPU utilization and is only applicable to data sets that benefit from clustered columnstore indexes or data compression.

### Storage space governance

In Premium and Business Critical service tiers, customer data including *data files*, *transaction log files*, and *tempdb files* is stored on the local SSD storage of the machine hosting the database or elastic pool. Local SSD storage provides high IOPS and throughput, and low IO latency. In addition to customer data, local storage is used for the operating system, management software, monitoring data and logs, and other files necessary for system operation.

The size of local storage is finite and depends on hardware capabilities, which determine the **maximum local storage** limit, or local storage set aside for customer data. This limit is set to maximize customer data storage, while ensuring safe and reliable system operation. To find the **maximum local storage** value for each service objective, see resource limits documentation for [single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md) and [elastic pools](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md).

You can also find this value, and the amount of local storage currently used by a given database or elastic pool, using the following query:

```sql
SELECT server_name, database_name, slo_name, user_data_directory_space_quota_mb, user_data_directory_space_usage_mb
FROM sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance
WHERE database_id = DB_ID();
```

|Column|Description|
| :----- | :----- |
|`server_name`|Logical server name|
|`database_name`|Database name|
|`slo_name`|Service objective name, including hardware generation|
|`user_data_directory_space_quota_mb`|**Maximum local storage**, in MB|
|`user_data_directory_space_usage_mb`|Current local storage consumption by data files, transaction log files, and tempdb files, in MB. Updated every five minutes.|
|||

This query should be executed in the user database, not in the master database. For elastic pools, the query can be executed in any database in the pool. Reported values apply to the entire pool.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Premium and Business Critical service tiers, if the workload attempts to increase combined local storage consumption by data files, transaction log files, and tempdb files over the **maximum local storage** limit, an out-of-space error will occur.

As databases are created, deleted, and increase or decrease in size, local storage consumption on a machine fluctuates over time. If the system detects that available local storage on a machine is low, and a database or an elastic pool is at risk of running out of space, it will move the database or elastic pool to a different machine with sufficient local storage available.

This move occurs in an online fashion, similarly to a database scaling operation, and has a similar [impact](single-database-scale.md#impact), including a short (seconds) failover at the end of the operation. This failover terminates open connections and rolls back transactions, potentially impacting applications using the database at that time.

Because all data is copied to local storage volumes on different machines, moving larger databases may require a substantial amount of time. During that time, if local space consumption by the database or elastic pool, or by the tempdb database grows rapidly, the risk of running out of space increases. The system initiates database movement in a balanced fashion to minimize out-of-space errors while avoiding unnecessary failovers.

> [!NOTE]
> Database movement due to insufficient local storage only occurs in the Premium or Business Critical service tiers. It does not occur in the Hyperscale, General Purpose, Standard, and Basic service tiers, because in those tiers data files are not stored in local storage.

## Tempdb sizes

Size limits for tempdb in Azure SQL Database depend on the purchasing and deployment model. 

To learn more, review tempdb size limits for: 
- vCore purchasing model: [single databases](resource-limits-vcore-single-databases.md), [pooled databases](resource-limits-vcore-elastic-pools.md)
- DTU purchasing model: [single databases](resource-limits-dtu-single-databases.md#tempdb-sizes),  [pooled databases](resource-limits-dtu-elastic-pools.md#tempdb-sizes).
