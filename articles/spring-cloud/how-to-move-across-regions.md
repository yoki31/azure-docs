# Move an Azure Spring Cloud service instance to another region

This article shows you how to move your Azure Spring Cloud service instance to another region. Moving your instance is useful, for example, as part of a disaster recovery plan or to create a duplicate testing environment.

You can't move an Azure Spring Cloud instance from one region to another directly, but you can use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to deploy to a new region. For more information about using Azure Resource Manager and templates, see [Quickstart: Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates by using the Azure portal](../azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal.md).

Before you move your service instance, you should be aware of the following limitations:

- Different feature sets are supported by different pricing tiers (SKUs). If you change the SKU, you may need to change the template to include only features supported by the target SKU.
- You might not be able to move all sub-resources in Azure Spring Cloud using the template. Your move may require extra setup after the template is deployed. For more information, see the [Configure the new Azure Spring Cloud service instance](#configure-the-new-azure-spring-cloud-service-instance) section.
- When you move a virtual network (VNet) instance (see [Deploy Azure Spring Cloud in a virtual network](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md)), you'll need to create new network resources.

## Prerequisites

- A running Azure Spring Cloud instance.
- A target region that supports Azure Spring Cloud and its related features.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if you aren't using the Azure portal.

## Export the template

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

First, use the following steps to export the template:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **All resources** in the left menu, then select your Azure Spring Cloud instance.
1. Under **Automation**, select **Export template**.
1. Select **Download** on the **Export template** pane.
1. Locate the *.zip* file, unzip it, and get the *template.json* file. This file contains the resource template.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

First, use the following command to export the template:

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription <resource-subscription-id>
az group export --resource-group <resource-group> --resource-ids <resource-id>
```

---

## Modify the template

Next, use the following steps to modify the *template.json* file. In the examples shown here, the new Azure Spring Cloud instance name is *new-service-name*, and the previous instance name is *old-service-name*.

1. Change all `name` instances in the template from *old-service-name* to *new-service-name*, as shown in the following example:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "_comment": "the following line was changed from 'old-service-name'",
       "name": "[parameters('new-service-name')]",
       ….
   }
   ```

1. Change the `location` instances in the template to the new target location, as shown in the following example:

   ```json
       {
           "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
           "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
           "name": "[parameters('new_service_name')]",
           "_comment": "the following line was changed from 'old-region'",
           "location": "{new-region}",
           …..
       }
   ```

1. If the instance you're moving is a VNet instance, you'll need to update the target VNet resource `parameters` instances in the template, as shown in the following example:

   ```json
   "parameters": {
       …
       "virtualNetworks_service_vnet_externalid": {
           "_comment": "the following line was changed from 'old-vnet-resource-id'",
           "defaultValue": "{new-vnet-resource-id}",
           "type": "String"
       }
   },
   ```

   Be sure the subnets `serviceRuntimeSubnetId` and `appSubnetId` (defined in the service `networkProfile`) exist.

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "name": "[parameters('Spring_new_service_name')]",
       …
       "properties": {
           "networkProfile": {
               "serviceRuntimeSubnetId": "[concat(parameters('virtualNetworks_service_vnet_externalid'), '/subnets/apps-subnet')]",
               "appSubnetId": "[concat(parameters('virtualNetworks_service_vnet_externalid'), '/subnets/service-runtime-subnet')]",
           }
       }
   }
   ```

1. If any custom domain resources are configured, you need to create the CNAME records as described in [Tutorial: Map an existing custom domain to Azure Spring Cloud](tutorial-custom-domain.md). Be sure the record name is expected for the new service name.

1. Change all `relativePath` instances in the template `properties` for all app resources to `<default>`, as shown in the following example:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/deployments",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "name": "[concat(parameters('Spring_new_service_name'), '/api-gateway/default')]",
       …
       "properties": {
           "active": true,
           "source": {
               "type": "Jar",
               "_comment": "the following line was changed to 'default'",
               "relativePath": "<default>"
           },
           …
       }
   }
   ```

    After the app is created, it uses a default banner application. You'LL need to deploy the JAR files again using the Azure CLI. For more information, see the [Configure the new Azure Spring Cloud service instance](#configure-the-new-azure-spring-cloud-service-instance) section below.

1. If service binding was used and you want to import it to the new service instance, add the `key` property for the target bound resource. In the following example, a bound MySQL database would be included:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring/apps/bindings",
       "apiVersion": "{api-version}",
       "name": "[concat(parameters('Spring_new_service_name'), '/api-gateway/mysql')]",
       …
       "_comment": "the following line imports a mysql binding",
       "properties": {
           "resourceId": "[parameters('servers_test_mysql_name_externalid')]",
           "key": "{mysql-password}",
           "bindingParameters": {
               "databaseName": "mysql",
               "username": "{mysql-user-name}"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## Deploy the template

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

After you modify the template, use the following steps to deploy the template and create the new resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the top search box, search for *Deploy a custom template*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-move-across-regions/search-deploy-template.png" alt-text="Azure portal screenshot showing search results." lightbox="media/how-to-move-across-regions/search-deploy-template.png" border="true":::

1. Under **Services**, select **Deploy a custom template**.
1. Go to the **Select a template** tab, then select **Build your own template in the editor**.
1. In the template editor, paste in the *template.json* file you modified earlier, then select **Save**.
1. In the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information:

    - The target subscription.
    - The target resource group.
    - The target region.
    - Any other parameters required for the template.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-move-across-regions/deploy-template.png" alt-text="Azure portal screenshot showing 'Custom deployment' pane.":::

1. Select **Review + create** to create the target service instance.
1. Wait until the template has deployed successfully. If the deployment fails, select **Deployment details** to view the failure reason, then update the template or configurations accordingly.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

After you modify the template, use the following command to deploy the custom template and create the new resource.

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription <resource-subscription-id>
az deployment group create \
  --name <custom-deployment-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --template-file <path-to-template> \
  --parameters <param-name-1>=<param-value-1>
```

Wait until the template has deployed successfully. If the deployment fails, view the deployment details with the command `az deployment group list`, then update the template or configurations accordingly.

## Configure the new Azure Spring Cloud service instance

Some features aren't exported to the template, or can't be imported with a template. You must manually set up some Azure Spring Cloud items on the new instance after the template deployment completes successfully. The following guidelines describe these requirements:

- The JAR files for the previous service aren't deployed directly to the new service instance. To deploy all apps, follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Build and deploy apps to Azure Spring Cloud](quickstart-deploy-apps.md). If there's no active deployment configured automatically, you must configure a production deployment. For more information, see [Set up a staging environment in Azure Spring Cloud](how-to-staging-environment.md).
- Config Server won't be imported automatically. To set up Config Server on your new instance, see [Set up a Spring Cloud Config Server instance for your service](how-to-config-server.md).
- Managed identity will be created automatically for the new service instance, but the object ID will be different from the previous instance. For managed identity to work in the new service instance, follow the instructions in [How to enable system-assigned managed identity for applications in Azure Spring Cloud](how-to-enable-system-assigned-managed-identity.md).
- For Monitoring -> Metrics, see [Metrics for Azure Spring Cloud](concept-metrics.md). To avoid mixing the data, we recommend that you create a new Log Analytics instance to collect the new data. You should also create a new instance for other monitoring configurations.
- For Monitoring -> Diagnostic settings and logs, see [Analyze logs and metrics with diagnostics settings](diagnostic-services.md).
- For Monitoring -> Application Insights, see [Application Insights Java In-Process Agent in Azure Spring Cloud](how-to-application-insights.md).
