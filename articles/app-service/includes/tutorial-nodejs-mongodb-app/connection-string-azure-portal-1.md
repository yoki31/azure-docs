Navigate to your Cosmos DB account. If you have just created your Cosmos DB account, you can select the *Go to resource* button to be taken directly to the account. Or you can use the search box at the top of the screen to search for and navigate to your Cosmos DB database.

1. On the page for your Cosmos DB, make sure the Quick start item is selected in the left menu. You will see text box labeled **Primary Connection String**. While there are tabs for different languages, the connection string is the same regardless of language.
2. Copy the value of the connection string into your clipboard buffer.
