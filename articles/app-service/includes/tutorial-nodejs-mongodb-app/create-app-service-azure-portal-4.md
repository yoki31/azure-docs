The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and the cost of those resources. You can learn more about choosing an App Service plan in the article [App Service plan overview](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans). For a full list of App Service plans, view the [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) page.<br>
<br>
For this example, select *Dev / Test* at the top of the screen and select B1 (Basic) plan.  The B1 Basic plan will incur a small charge against your Azure account but offers better performance than the F1 (Free) plan.<br>
<br>
When finished, select *Apply* to apply your changes.
