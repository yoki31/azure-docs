The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and the cost of those resources.<br>
<br>
For this example, select **Dev / Test** at the top of the screen and then select the **B1** (Basic) plan.  The B1 Basic plan will incur a small charge against your Azure account but is recommended for better performance over the F1 (Free) plan.<br>
<br>
When finished, select **Apply** to apply your changes.
