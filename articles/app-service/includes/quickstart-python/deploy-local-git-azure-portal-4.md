On the *Deployment Center* page

1. Navigate to the **Local Git/FTPS credentials** tab.
1. Locate the username and password under the **Application scope** credentials.
1. Keep this screen open so you can copy these credentials momentarily when you deploy your code to the remote repository. Only use the part of the username after the `\` character that starts with a `$`, for example `$msdocs-python-webapp-quickstart-123`.

When you push code to the remote Git repository for the first time, these credentials are needed to authenticate to the remote repository.
