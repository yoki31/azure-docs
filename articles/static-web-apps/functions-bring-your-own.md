# Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps

Azure Static Web Apps APIs are supported by two possible configurations: managed functions and bring your own functions. See the [API reference](apis.md) for details between the two configurations.

This article demonstrates how to link an existing Azure Functions app to an Azure Static Web Apps resource.

> [!NOTE]
> Bring your own functions is only available in the Azure Static Web Apps Standard plan.

## Example

Consider an existing Azure Functions app that exposes an endpoint via the following location.

```url
https://my-functions-app.azurewebsites.net/api/getProducts
```

Once linked, you can access that same endpoint through the `api` path from your static web app, as shown in this example URL.

```url
https://red-sea-123.azurestaticapps.net/api/getProducts
```

 Both endpoint URLs point to the same function.

## Link an existing Azure Functions app

Before you associate an existing Functions app, you first need to adjust to configuration of your static web app.

1. Set `api_location` value to an empty string (`""`) in the [workflow configuration](./build-configuration.md) file.

1. Open your Static Web Apps instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. From the _Settings_ menu, select **Functions**.

1. From the _Environment_ dropdown, select **Production**.

1. Next to the _Functions type_ label, select **Link to a Function app**.

1. From the _Subscription_ dropdown, select your Azure subscription name.

1. From the _Function App_ dropdown, select the name of the existing Functions app you want to link to your static web app.

1. Select the **Link** button.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to set the `api_location` value to an empty string (`""`) in the [workflow configuration](./build-configuration.md) file before you link an existing Functions application.

## Deployment

You're responsible for setting up a [deployment workflow](../azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies.md) for your Azure Functions app.

## Security constraints

- **Authentication and authorization:** If authentication and authorization policies aren't already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you enable authentication and authorization in your linked Functions app, it must use Azure App Service Authentication and authorization provider version 2.

- **Required public accessibility:** An existing Functions app needs to not apply the following security configurations.
  - Restricting the IP address of the Functions app.
  - Restricting traffic through private link or service endpoints.

- **Function access keys:** If your function requires an [access key](../azure-functions/security-concepts.md#function-access-keys), then you must provide the key with calls from the static app to the API.

## Restrictions

- Only one Azure Functions app is available to a single static web app.
- The `api_location` value in the [workflow configuration](./build-configuration.md) must be set to an empty string.
- Only supported in the Static Web Apps production environment.
- While your Azure Functions app may respond to various triggers, the static web app can only access functions via Http endpoints.
