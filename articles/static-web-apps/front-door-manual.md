# Tutorial: Manually configure Azure Front Door for Azure Static Web Apps

Learn to add [Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-overview.md) as the CDN for your static web app.  Azure Front Door is a scalable and secure entry point for fast delivery of your web applications.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium instance
> - Associate Azure Front Door with your Azure Static Web Apps site

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial requires the Azure Static Web Apps Standard and Azure Front Door Standard / Premium plans.

## Copy web app URL

1. Navigate to the Azure portal.

1. Open the static web app that you want to apply Azure Front Door.

1. Go to the *Overview* section.

1. Copy the *URL* to your clipboard for later use.

## Add Azure Front Door

1. Navigate to the Azure home screen.

1. Select **Create a resource**.

1. Search for **Front Door**.

1. Select **Front Door Standard/Premium**.

    Make sure to select the service labeled *Front Door Standard/Premium* and not the plain *Front Door* option.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Select the **Azure Front Door Standard/Premium** option.

1. Select the **Quick create** option.

1. Select the **Continue to create a front door** button.

1. In the *Basics* tab, enter the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Enter a resource group name. This name is often the same group name used by your static web app. |
    | Resource group location | If you create a new resource group, enter the location nearest you. |
    | Name | Enter **my-static-web-app-front-door**. |
    | Tier | Select **Standard**. |
    | Endpoint name | Enter a unique name for your Front Door host. |
    | Origin type | Select **Custom**. |
    | Origin host name | Enter the hostname of your static web app that you set aside from the beginning of this tutorial. Make sure your value does not include a trailing slash or protocol. (For example, `desert-rain-04056.azurestaticapps.net`)  |
    | Caching | Check the **Enable caching** checkbox. |
    | Query string caching behavior | Select **Use Query string** from the dropdown. |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

    The creation process may take a few minutes to complete.

1. Select **Go to resource**.

## Disable cache for auth workflow

Add the following settings to disable Front Door's caching policies from trying to cache authentication and authorization-related pages.

### Add a condition

1. Under *Settings*, select **Rule set**.

1. Select **Add**.

1. In the *Rule set name* textbox, enter **Security**.

1. In the *Rule name* textbox, enter **NoCacheAuthRequests**.

1. Select **Add a condition**.

1. Select **Request path**.

1. Select **Begins With** in the *Operator* drop down.

1. Select the **Edit** link above the *Value* textbox.

1. Enter **/.auth** in the textbox.

1. Select the **Update** button.

1. Select the **No transform** option from the *Case transform* dropdown.

### Add an action

1. Select the **Add an action** dropdown.

1. Select **Cache expiration**.

1. Select **Bypass cache** in the *Cache Behavior* dropdown.

1. Select the **Save** button.

### Associate rule to an endpoint

Now that the rule is created, you apply the rule to a Front Door endpoint.

1. Select the **Unassociated** link.

1. Select the Endpoint name to which you want to apply the caching rule.

1. Select the **Next** button.

1. Select the **Associate** button.

## Copy Front Door ID

Use the following steps to copy the Front Door instance's unique identifier.

1. Select the **Overview** link on the left-hand navigation.

1. From the *Overview* window, copy the value labeled **Front Door ID** and paste it into a file for later use.

## Update static web app configuration

To complete the integration with Front Door, you need to update the application configuration file to:

- Restrict traffic to your site only through Front Door
- Restrict traffic to your site only from your Front Door instance
- Define which domains can access your site
- Disable caching for secured routes

Open the [staticwebapp.config.json](configuration.md) file for your site and make the following changes.

1. Restrict traffic to only use Front Door by adding the following section to the configuration file:

    ```json
    "networking": {
      "allowedIpRanges": ["AzureFrontDoor.Backend"]
    }
    ```

1. To define which Azure Front Door instances and domains can access your site, add the `forwardingGateway` section.

    ```json
    "forwardingGateway": {
      "requiredHeaders": {
        "X-Azure-FDID" : "<YOUR-FRONT-DOOR-ID>"
      },
      "allowedForwardedHosts": [
        "my-sitename.azurefd.net"
      ]
    }
    ```

    First, configure your app to only allow traffic from your Front Door instance. In every backend request, Front Door automatically adds an `X-Azure-FDID` header that contains your Front Door instance ID. By configuring your static web app to require this header, it will restrict traffic exclusively to your Front Door instance. In the `forwardingGateway` section in your configuration file, add the `requiredHeaders` section and define the `X-Azure-FDID` header. Replace `<YOUR-FRONT-DOOR-ID>` with the *Front Door ID* you set aside earlier.

    Next, add the Azure Front Door hostname (not the Azure Static Web Apps hostname) into the `allowedForwardedHosts` array. If you have custom domains configured in your Front Door instance, also include them in this list.

    In this example, replace `my-sitename.azurefd.net` with the Azure Front Door hostname for your site.

1. For all secured routes in your app, disable Azure Front Door caching by adding `"Cache-Control": "no-store"` to the route header definition.

    ```json
    {
        "route": "/members",
        "allowedRoles": ["authenticated, members"],
        "headers": {
            "Cache-Control": "no-store"
        }
    }
    ```

With this configuration, your site is no longer available via the generated `*.azurestaticapps.net` hostname, but exclusively through the hostnames configured in your Front Door instance.

## Considerations

- **Custom domains**: Now that Front Door is managing your site, you no long use the Azure Static Web Apps custom domain feature. Azure Front Door has a separate process for adding a custom domain. Refer to [Add a custom domain to your Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain.md). When you add a custom domain to Front Door, you'll need to update your static web app configuration file to include it in the `allowedForwardedHosts` list.

- **Traffic statistics**: By default, Azure Front Door configures [health probes](../frontdoor/front-door-health-probes.md) that may affect your traffic statistics. You may want to edit the default values for the [health probes](../frontdoor/front-door-health-probes.md).

- **Serving old versions**: When you deploy updates to existing files in your static web app, Azure Front Door may continue to serve older versions of your files until their [time-to-live](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) expires. [Purge the Azure Front Door cache](../frontdoor/front-door-caching.md#cache-purge) for the affected paths to ensure the latest files are served.

## Clean up resources

If you no longer want to use the resources created in this tutorial, delete the Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Front Door instances.
