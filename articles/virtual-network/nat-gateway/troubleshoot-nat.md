## Configuration issues with NAT gateway

### NAT gateway configuration basics

Check the following configurations to ensure that NAT gateway can be used to direct traffic outbound:
1. At least one public IP address or one public IP prefix is attached to NAT gateway. At least one public IP address must be associated with the NAT gateway for it to provide outbound connectivity. 
2. At least one subnet is attached to a NAT gateway. You can attach multiple subnets to a NAT gateway for going outbound, but those subnets must exist within the same virtual network. NAT gateway cannot span beyond a single virtual network. 

### How to validate connectivity

[Virtual Network NAT gateway](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview#vnet-nat-basics) supports IPv4 UDP and TCP protocols. ICMP is not supported and is expected to fail. 

To validate end-to-end connectivity of NAT gateway, follow these steps: 
1. Validate that your [NAT gateway public IP address is being used](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/tutorial-create-nat-gateway-portal#test-nat-gateway).
2. Conduct TCP connection tests and UDP-specific application layer tests.
3. Look at NSG flow logs to analyze outbound traffic flows from NAT gateway.

Refer to the table below for which tools to use to validate NAT gateway connectivity.

| Operating system | Generic TCP connection test | TCP application layer test | UDP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | nc (generic connection test) | curl (TCP application layer test) | application specific |
| Windows | [PsPing](/sysinternals/downloads/psping) | PowerShell [Invoke-WebRequest](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest) | application specific |

To analyze outbound traffic from NAT gateway, use NSG flow logs.
* To learn more about NSG flow logs, see [NSG flow log overview](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview).
* For guides on how to enable NSG flow logs, see [Enabling NSG flow logs](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview#enabling-nsg-flow-logs).
* For guides on how to read NSG flow logs, see [Working with NSG flow logs](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview#working-with-flow-logs).

## Configuration issues with subnets and virtual networks using NAT gateway

### Basic SKU resources cannot exist in the same subnet as NAT gateway

NAT gateway is not compatible with basic resources, such as Basic Load Balancer or Basic Public IP. Basic resources must be placed on a subnet not associated with a NAT Gateway. Basic Load Balancer and Basic Public IP can be upgraded to standard to work with NAT gateway. 
* To upgrade a basic load balancer to standard, see [upgrade from basic public to standard public load balancer](/azure/load-balancer/upgrade-basic-standard).
* To upgrade a basic public IP to standard, see [upgrade from basic public to standard public IP](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-upgrade-portal).

### NAT gateway cannot be attached to a gateway subnet

NAT gateway cannot be deployed in a gateway subnet. VPN gateway uses gateway subnets for VPN connections between site-to-site Azure virtual networks and local networks or between two Azure virtual networks. See [VPN gateway overview](/azure/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) to learn more about how gateway subnets are used.

### IPv6 coexistence

[Virtual Network NAT gateway](nat-overview.md) supports IPv4 UDP and TCP protocols. NAT gateway cannot be associated to an IPv6 Public IP address or IPv6 Public IP Prefix. NAT gateway can be deployed on a dual stack subnet, but will still only use IPv4 Public IP addresses for directing outbound traffic. Deploy NAT gateway on a dual stack subnet when you need IPv6 resources to exist in the same subnet as IPv4 resources.

## SNAT exhaustion due to NAT gateway configuration

Common SNAT exhaustion issues with NAT gateway typically have to do with the configurations on the NAT gateway. Common SNAT exhaustion issues include: 
* NAT gateway idle timeout timers being set higher than their default value of 4 minutes. 
* Outbound connectivity on NAT gateway not scaled out enough. 

### Idle timeout timers have been changed to higher value their default values

NAT gateway resources have a default TCP idle timeout of 4 minutes.  If this setting is changed to a higher value, NAT gateway will hold on to flows longer and can cause [unnecessary pressure on SNAT port inventory](nat-gateway-resource.md#timers).

UDP flows (for example DNS lookups) allocate SNAT ports for the duration of the idle timeout. The longer the idle timeout, the higher the pressure on SNAT ports. 

Check the following [NAT gateway metrics](nat-metrics.md) in Azure Monitor to determine if SNAT port exhaustion is happening: 

*Total SNAT Connection*
* "Sum" aggregation shows high connection volume.
* "Failed" connection state shows transient or persistent failures over time.

*Dropped Packets*
* "Sum" aggregation shows packets dropping consistent with high connection volume.

**Mitigation**

Explore the impact of reducing TCP idle timeout to lower values including default idle timeout of 4 minutes to free up SNAT port inventory earlier. 

Consider [asynchronous polling patterns](/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply) for long-running operations to free up connection resources for other operations.

Long-lived flows (for example reused TCP connections) should use TCP keepalives or application layer keepalives to avoid intermediate systems timing out. Increasing the idle timeout is a last resort and may not resolve the root cause. A long timeout can cause low rate failures when timeout expires and introduce delay and unnecessary failures.

### Outbound connectivity not scaled out enough

NAT gateway provides 64,000 SNAT ports to a subnetâ€™s resources for each public IP address attached to it. If outbound connections are dropping because SNAT ports are being exhausted, then NAT gateway may not be scaled out enough to handle the workload. More public IP addresses may need to be added to NAT gateway in order to provide more SNAT ports for outbound connectivity.

The table below describes two common scenarios in which outbound connectivity may not be scaled out enough and how to validate and mitigate these issues: 

| Scenario | Evidence |Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| You're experiencing contention for SNAT ports and SNAT port exhaustion during periods of high usage. | You run the following [metrics](nat-metrics.md) in Azure Monitor: **Total SNAT Connection**: "Sum" aggregation shows high connection volume. "Failed" connection state shows transient or persistent failures over time. **Dropped Packets**: "Sum" aggregation shows packets dropping consistent with high connection volume.  | Determine if you can add more public IP addresses or public IP prefixes. This addition will allow for up to 16 IP addresses in total to your NAT gateway. This addition will provide more inventory for available SNAT ports (64,000 per IP address) and allow you to scale your scenario further.|
| You've already given 16 IP addresses and still are experiencing SNAT port exhaustion. | Attempt to add more IP addresses fails. Total number of IP addresses from public IP address resources or public IP prefix resources exceeds a total of 16. | Distribute your application environment across multiple subnets and provide a NAT gateway resource for each subnet. |

>[!NOTE]
>It is important to understand why SNAT exhaustion occurs. Make sure you are using the right patterns for scalable and reliable scenarios.  Adding more SNAT ports to a scenario without understanding the cause of the demand should be a last resort. If you do not understand why your scenario is applying pressure on SNAT port inventory, adding more SNAT ports to the inventory by adding more IP addresses will only delay the same exhaustion failure as your application scales.  You may be masking other inefficiencies and anti-patterns.

## Connection issues with NAT gateway and integrated services

### Azure App Service regional VNet integration turned off

NAT gateway can be used with Azure app services to allow applications to make outbound calls from a virtual network. To use this integration between Azure app services and NAT gateway, regional virtual network integration must be enabled. See [how regional virtual network integration works](/azure/app-service/overview-vnet-integration#how-regional-virtual-network-integration-works) to learn more.

To use NAT gateway with Azure App services, follow these steps: 
1. Ensure that your application(s) are integrated with a subnet. 
2. Ensure that regional virtual network integration is enabled for the subnet that your apps will use for going outbound by turning on **Route All**.
3. Create a NAT gateway resource. 
4. Create a new public IP address or attach an existing public IP address in your network to NAT gateway.
5. Assign NAT gateway to the same subnet being used for VNet integration with your application(s). 

To see step-by-step instructions on how to configure NAT gateway with VNet integration, see [Configuring NAT gateway integration](/azure/app-service/networking/nat-gateway-integration#configuring-nat-gateway-integration)

A couple important notes about the NAT gateway and Azure App Services integration: 
* VNet integration does not provide inbound private access to your app from the virtual network. 
* Because of the nature of how VNet integration operates, the traffic from virtual network integration does not show up in Azure Network Watcher or NSG flow logs. 

### Port 25 cannot be used for regional VNet integration with NAT gateway

Port 25 is an SMTP port that is used to send email. Azure app services regional VNet integration cannot use port 25 by design. In a scenario where regional VNet integration is enabled for NAT gateway to connect an application to an email SMTP server, traffic will be blocked on port 25 despite NAT gateway working with all other ports for outbound traffic. This block on port 25 cannot be removed.

**Work around solution:**
* Set up port forwarding to a Windows VM to route traffic to Port 25. 

## NAT gateway public IP not being used for outbound traffic

### VMs hold on to prior SNAT IP with active connection after NAT gateway added to a VNet

[Virtual Network NAT gateway](nat-overview.md) supersedes outbound connectivity for a subnet. When transitioning from default SNAT or load balancer outbound SNAT to using NAT gateway, new connections will immediately begin using the IP address(es) associated with the NAT gateway resource. However, if a virtual machine still has an established connection during the switch to NAT gateway, the connection will continue using the old SNAT IP address that was assigned when the connection was established. 

Test and resolve issues with VMs holding on to old SNAT IP addresses by: 
1. Make sure you are really establishing a new connection and that connections are not being reused due to having already existed in the OS or because the browser was caching the connections in a connection pool. For example, when using curl in PowerShell, make sure to specify the -DisableKeepalive parameter to force a new connection. If you are using a browser, connections may also be pooled. 
2. It is not necessary to reboot a virtual machine in a subnet configured to NAT gateway. However, if a virtual machine is rebooted, the connection state is flushed. When the connection state has been flushed, all connections will begin using the NAT gateway resource's IP address(es). However, this is a side effect of the virtual machine being rebooted and not an indicator that a reboot is required. 

If you are still having trouble, open a support case for further troubleshooting. 

### UDR supersedes NAT gateway for going outbound

When NAT gateway is attached to a subnet also associated with a user defined route (UDR) for routing traffic to the internet, the UDR will take precedence over the NAT gateway. The internet traffic will flow from the IP configured for the UDR rather than from the NAT gateway public IP address(es). 

The order of precedence for internet routing configurations is as follows: 

UDR >> NAT gateway >> default system 

Test and resolve issues with a UDR configured to your virtual network by: 
1. [Testing that the NAT gateway public IP](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/tutorial-create-nat-gateway-portal#test-nat-gateway) is used for outbound traffic. If a different IP is being used, it could be because of a UDR, follow the remaining steps on how to check for and remove UDRs.
2. Check for UDRs in the virtual networkâ€™s route table, refer to [view route tables](/azure/virtual-network/manage-route-table#view-route-tables).
3. Remove the UDR from the route table by following [create, change, or delete an Azure route table](/azure/virtual-network/manage-route-table#change-a-route-table).

Once the UDR is removed from the routing table, the NAT gateway public IP should now take precedence in routing outbound traffic to the internet. 

## Connection failures in the Azure infrastructure

Azure monitors and operates its infrastructure with great care. However, transient failures can still occur, there is no guarantee that transmissions are lossless.  Use design patterns that allow for SYN retransmissions for TCP applications. Use connection timeouts large enough to permit TCP SYN retransmission to reduce transient impacts caused by a lost SYN packet.

**What to check for:**

* Check for [SNAT exhaustion](#snat-exhaustion-due-to-nat-gateway-configuration).
* The configuration parameter in a TCP stack that controls the SYN retransmission behavior is called RTO ([Retransmission Time-Out](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793)). The RTO value is adjustable but typically 1 second or higher by default with exponential back-off.  If your application's connection time-out is too short (for example 1 second), you may see sporadic connection timeouts.  Increase the application connection time-out.
* If you observe longer, unexpected timeouts with default application behaviors, open a support case for further troubleshooting.

We don't recommend artificially reducing the TCP connection timeout or tuning the RTO parameter.

## Connection failures with public internet transit

The chances of transient failures increases with a longer path to the destination and more intermediate systems. It's expected that transient failures can increase in frequency over [Azure infrastructure](#connection-failures-in-the-azure-infrastructure). 

Follow the same guidance as preceding [Azure infrastructure](#connection-failures-in-the-azure-infrastructure) section.

## Connection failures at the public internet destination

The previous sections apply, along with the internet endpoint that communication is established with. Other factors that can impact connectivity success are:

* Traffic management on destination side, including,
- API rate limiting imposed by the destination side.
- Volumetric DDoS mitigations or transport layer traffic shaping.
* Firewall or other components at the destination. 

Use NAT gateway [metrics](nat-metrics.md) in Azure monitor to diagnose connection issues: 
* Look at packet count at the source and the destination (if available) to determine how many connection attempts were made.  
* Look at dropped packets to see how many packets were dropped by NAT gateway. 

What else to check for:
* Check for [SNAT exhaustion](#snat-exhaustion-due-to-nat-gateway-configuration).
* Validate connectivity to an endpoint in the same region or elsewhere for comparison. 
* If you are creating high volume or transaction rate testing, explore if reducing the rate reduces the occurrence of failures. 
* If changing rate impacts the rate of failures, check if API rate limits or other constraints on the destination side might have been reached. 

If your investigation is inconclusive, open a support case for further troubleshooting.

## Connection failures due to TCP Resets received

The NAT gateway generates TCP resets on the source VM for traffic that isn't recognized as in progress.

One possible reason is the TCP connection has idle timed out. You can adjust the idle timeout from 4 minutes to up to 120 minutes.

TCP Resets aren't generated on the public side of NAT gateway resources. TCP resets on the destination side are generated by the source VM, not the NAT gateway resource.

Keep in mind that a long timeout can cause low-rate failures when timeout expires and introduce delay and unnecessary connection failures.  

Open a support case for further troubleshooting if necessary.
