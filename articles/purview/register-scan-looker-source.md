## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | No | No| [Yes](#lineage)|

The supported Looker server version is 7.2.

When scanning Looker source, Azure Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Server
    - Folders
    - Projects
    - Models
    - Dashboards
    - Looks
    - Explore diagrams including the joins
    - Views including the dimensions, measures, parameters, and filters
    - Layouts including the chart layouts, table layouts, text, and fields

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among views and layouts.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire Looker server, or scope the scan to a subset of Looker projects matching the given name(s).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Azure Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).

* Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) is installed on the virtual machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed.

* Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

## Register

This section describes how to register Looker in Azure Purview using the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Authentication for registration

An API3 key is required to connect to the Looker server. The API3 key consists in a public client_id and a private client_secret and follows an OAuth2 authentication pattern.

### Steps to register

1. Navigate to your Azure Purview account.
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register.**
1. On Register sources, select **Looker**. Select **Continue.**

On the Register sources (Looker) screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the Looker API URL in the **Server API URL** field. The default port for API requests is port 19999. Also, all Looker API endpoints require an HTTPS connection. For example: 'https://azurepurview.cloud.looker.com'

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

1. Finish to register the data source.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan Looker to automatically identify assets and classify your data. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md)

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. In the Management Center, select Integration runtimes. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up on the VM where erwin Mart instance is running. If it is not set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to set up a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered **Looker** server.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured self-hosted integration runtime.

    1. **Server API URL** is auto populated based on the value entered during registration.

    1. **Credential:** While configuring Looker credential, make sure to:

        * Select **Basic Authentication** as the Authentication method
        * Provide your Looker API3 key's client ID in the User name field
        * Save your Looker API3 key's client secret in the key vault's secret.

        To access client ID and client secret, navigate to Looker -\>Admin -\> Users -\> Select **Edit** on a user -\> Select **EditKeys** -\> Use the Client ID and Client Secret or create a new one.

        To understand more on credentials, refer to the link [here](manage-credentials.md)

    1. **Project filter** -- Scope your scan by providing a semicolon separated list of Looker projects. This option is used to select looks and dashboards by their parent project.

    1. **Maximum memory available**: Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of erwin Mart to be scanned.

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-looker-source/setup-scan.png" alt-text="trigger scan" border="true":::

1. Select **Test connection.**

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select on **Save and Run**.

## Lineage

After scanning your Looker source, you can [browse data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md) or [search data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) to view the asset details. 

Go to the asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset relationship when applicable. Refer to the [supported capabilities](#supported-capabilities) section on the supported Looker lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see [data lineage](concept-data-lineage.md) and [lineage user guide](catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).
