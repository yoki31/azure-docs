  - name: Licensing and setup
    questions:
      - question: What are the licensing requirements to use sensitivity labels on files and database columns in Azure Purview? 
        answer: |
          To use sensitivity labels in Azure Purview, you'll need at least one Microsoft 365 license/account within the same Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant as your Azure Purview account.  

          The following Microsoft 365 licenses are required to automatically apply sensitivity labels to your assets in [Microsoft 365](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#which-licenses-provide-the-rights-for-a-user-to-benefit-from-the-service-10) and [Azure Purview](how-to-automatically-label-your-content.md):  
          
          * Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5
          * Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5 Compliance 
          * Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5 Information Protection, and Governance,  
          * Office 365 E5, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5/A5/G5, and AIP Plan 2 
          
          For more information, see [Microsoft 365 service descriptions](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection).

      - question: If my organization has multiple Azure Purview accounts within an Azure AD tenant, do I need to manually extend labels to each Azure Purview account separately?
        answer: |
          No. When you extend sensitivity labels to Azure Purview, those labels are extended to all the Azure Purview accounts in your tenant.

      - question: My organization already uses sensitivity labels in Microsoft 365. What is the impact of extending these labels to Azure Purview? Will it affect my existing setup in Microsoft 365? 
        answer: |
          Extending the labels to Azure Purview doesn't affect your Microsoft 365 setup or modify your assets in any way, including files and databases.  
          
          * When you extend sensitivity labels to Azure Purview, your Microsoft 365 setup will continue to work in the same way as usual. 
          * Extending the sensitivity labels allows Azure Purview to apply those labels to your Azure and multi-cloud assets in the Azure Purview catalog. The catalog is a metadata store and can be deleted by you at any time. 
          * Sensitivity labels are applied only to the asset metadata in the Azure Purview catalog and are not applied to the actual files and database columns. Applying sensitivity labels doesn't modify your files and databases in any way.</br></br>

  - name: Classifications vs sensitivity labels
    questions:
      
      - question: What is the difference between classifications and sensitivity labels in Azure Purview? 
        answer: |
          The following table lists the differences between classifications and sensitivity labels in Azure Purview:

          |Comparison|Classifications|Sensitivity labels|
          |---|---|---|
          |**Definition**| Classifications are regular expressions or patterns that can help identify data types that exist inside an asset. | Sensitivity labels are tags that allow organizations to categorize data based on business impact, while abstracting the type of data from the user. |
          |**Examples**| Social Security Number, Drive license number, Bank account number, etc. | Highly confidential, Confidential, General, Public, etc. |
          | **Scope** | The scope of classifications applied to an asset is limited to the Azure Purview account where the classifications were applied. If the data moves to an asset managed by another Azure Purview account, classifications applied in the original location are not visible in the new location. | Sensitivity labels applied on an asset travel with the data no matter where the data goes. For example, this means that sensitivity labels applied to a file in Microsoft 365 are automatically visible and remain applied to the file, even if it moves to Azure, SharePoint, or Teams. |
          | **Scan Process** | Scanning an asset in Azure Purview looks for both system-defined and user-defined (custom) classifications in your data. If found, classifications are added in the Azure Purview catalog for the scanned asset. | If you have sensitivity labels extended to Azure Purview and autolabeling rules defined, scanning an asset in Azure Purview applies the labels to assets in the catalog based on the classifications found in the scan. |
          | **Authoring environment** | Custom classifications and classification rules can be created in the Azure Purview studio. You can also create custom classifications in Microsoft 365. However, we do not yet support importing them to Azure Purview. | Manage sensitivity labels using the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-sensitivity-labels). |
          | **Assignment Limits** | Assets can have no classifications, or one or more classifications assigned. | Each asset can have only one sensitivity label. |
          | **Asset application workflow** | You can use Azure Purview to manually add or modify classifications that are assigned to an asset. | In Azure Purview, sensitivity labels are automatically assigned to assets based on classifications found. Applying labels manually in Azure Purview is not currently supported. | 
          | **More Information** | [Learn more about classifications](create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule.md). | [Learn more about sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-sensitivity-labels).|

      - question: Are classifications in Azure Purview and Sensitive Information Types (SITs) in Microsoft 365 the same thing? 
        answer: While classifications and SITs are fundamentally the same things, classifications are an Azure Purview concept and SITs are a Microsoft 365 concept. Both classifications and SITs are used by their respective services to identify the type of data found in an asset. 

      - question: I have created a custom Sensitive Information Type (SIT) in Microsoft 365 and used it in my autolabeling rules for schematized data assets. Can I use this custom SIT in Azure Purview? 
        answer: |
          No, [custom sensitive information types](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitive-information-type-learn-about#creating-custom-sensitive-information-types) from Microsoft 365 are not supported in Azure Purview at this time. Azure Purview currently only supports Microsoft 365 [built-in sensitive information types](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitive-information-type-learn-about).</br></br>
    
  - name: Labeling capabilities in Azure Purview
    questions:
      - question: How can I determine if consent has been granted to extend labeling to Azure Purview?
        answer: |
          Only compliance administrators, global administrators of the tenant, or a custom role that has access to the [Set-PolicyConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/set-policyconfig) cmdlet can [enable labels for Azure Purview](how-to-automatically-label-your-content.md). To verify whether an administrator has extended labeling to Azure Purview, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell and run the [Get-PolicyConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/get-policyconfig) cmdlet.  For example:
          
          ~~~powershell
          Get-PolicyConfig | format-list Azure Purview*
          ~~~

          When labeling has been extended to Azure Purview, you'll see **True** for the **PurviewLabelConsent** parameter and a timestamp indicating when consent was activated and an **ObjectId** of who activated consent.

          ~~~output
          PurviewLabelConsent        : True
          PurviewLabelConsentCaller  : d8675309-1111-2222-3333-1234567890ab
          PurviewLabelConsentTime    : 9/28/2021 6:04:45 PM
          PurviewLabelConsentDetails : {"Consent":true,"Caller":"d8675309-1111-2222-3333-1234567890ab","Time":"9/28/2021 6:04:45 PM"}
          ~~~

          When labeling has not been extended, you'll see False for **PurviewLabelConsent** like the example below:
          
          ~~~output
          PurviewLabelConsent        : False
          PurviewLabelConsentCaller  : 
          PurviewLabelConsentTime    : 
          PurviewLabelConsentDetails :
          ~~~

          This is different than auditing the action of adding Azure Purview to the scope of a sensitivity label. That activity can be found in the unified audit logs. For example,
          
          ~~~powershell
          Search-UnifiedAuditLog -Operations "Set-Label" -StartDate 10/05/2021 -EndDate 10/16/2021
          ~~~

          For more information, see [Search the audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance) in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.


      - question: Which data sources can I apply sensitivity labels to in Azure Purview? 
        answer: |
          You can apply sensitivity labels to all the data sources that can be scanned in Azure Purview. For more information, see [Supported data types for sensitivity labels in Azure Purview](create-sensitivity-label.md#supported-data-sources). 
          
      - question: Can I manually label an asset, or manually modify or remove a label in Azure Purview? 
        answer: |
          Azure Purview supports automatic labeling only. Labels are automatically applied to assets in Azure Purview based on the classifications found on the assets and the autolabeling rules for the labels. 
          
          Azure Purview does not currently support manually applying a label, modifying, or removing a label from an asset. 

      - question: Can automatic labeling apply to assets that may include credential content?
        answer: Azure Purview does not currently support scanning for credentials. When Azure Purview supports scanning for credentials, you should be able to apply labels based on credentials found.

      - question: Can I apply encryption and/or content marking on files in Azure Purview, similar to Microsoft 365?
        answer: No, we do not currently support encryption and content marking for files in Azure Purview.

      - question: Which file types can I apply sensitivity labels to in Azure Purview?
        answer: |
          You can apply sensitivity labels to all [Azure Purview supported data sources and file types](sources-and-scans.md).

      - question: Does Azure Purview currently support Data Loss Prevention capabilities?
        answer: |
          No, Azure Purview does not currently provide Data Loss Prevention capabilities. [Data Loss Prevention](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection#prevent-data-loss) is currently only supported in Microsoft 365.</br></br>

  - name: Access and roles
    questions:
      
      - question: Where can I manage my sensitivity labels? 
        answer: |
          Sensitivity labels are managed only in the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). For more information, see [How to create sensitivity labels in Microsoft 365](how-to-automatically-label-your-content.md).
          
          Support for managing sensitivity labels within Azure Purview Studio is not currently available.

      - question: Who can manage sensitivity labels in the Microsoft 365 compliance center? 
        answer: |
          The following built-in admin roles include permissions to manage sensitivity labels in the compliance center: 
          
          * Global Administrator  
          * Compliance Administrator 
          
          For more information, see [Permissions required to create and manage sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/get-started-with-sensitivity-labels#permissions-required-to-create-and-manage-sensitivity-labels).  After you have compliance and global administrators configured, those administrators can [give access to individual users](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center). 
          
      - question: Who can search and browse assets with sensitivity labels in Azure Purview? 
        answer: All users with at least data reader access to the Azure Purview account have permissions to search and browse assets with sensitivity labels in Azure Purview. 

      - question: Who can view the sensitivity label insights report in Azure Purview? 
        answer: All users with at least data reader access to the Azure Purview account have permissions to view sensitivity label insights reports in Azure Purview. </br></br>

  - name: Technical details
    questions:
      
      - question: Do Azure Purview and Microsoft 365 use the same classification engine? 
        answer: Yes, both Azure Purview and Microsoft 365 use the same classification engine. 

      - question: Does Azure Purview scan an entire asset when applying automatic labels to the database columns? 
        answer: |
          The Azure Purview scanner samples files as follows: 
          
          * **For structured file types**, Azure Purview samples 128 rows in each column or 1 MB, whichever is lower. 
          * **For document file formats**, Azure Purview samples 20 MB of each file. 
          * **If a document file is larger than 20 MB**, the document is not subject to a deep scan or classification. In such cases, Azure Purview captures only basic meta-data like file names and fully qualified names. 
          
      - question: If there are multiple sensitivity labels that meet the classification criteria, which label is applied?  
        answer: |
          Within Microsoft 365, sensitivity labels have a priority 'order' and Azure Purview uses the same order to assign labels. If there are multiple labels meeting the classification criteria, Azure Purview picks the label with the highest order.  
          
          For more information, see [Label priority order matters](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels#label-priority-order-matters).</br></br>
          
  - name: SQL data discovery and classification
    questions:  
      - question: Why does Microsoft support two classification experiences for SQL databases – 'Azure Purview' and 'SQL data discovery and classification'?  
        answer: |
          Azure Purview provides a classification and labeling experience for all your Azure assets including SQL databases. Azure Purview is intended for organizations that want to manage their entire data estate in a single place with the power of classification, labeling, alerting, and more. Azure Purview uses sensitivity labels, which have a global scope and travel with your data no matter where it moves to or what it transforms into. 
          
          In contrast, [SQL data discovery and classification](../azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview.md) is built into SQL. SQL data discovery and classification existed before Azure Purview as a way to provide basic capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting the sensitive data in your SQL databases. SQL data discovery and classification use local labels that do not have a global scope and do not support sensitivity labels. 
          
      - question: I applied labels in SQL data discovery and classification. Why are these labels not showing up on my asset in Azure Purview?
        answer: |
          SQL classification uses local labels, while Azure Purview uses sensitivity labels. Labels applied in the SQL classification experience will not show up in Azure Purview. For more details see [Labeling for SQL databases](create-sensitivity-label.md#labeling-for-sql-databases).
