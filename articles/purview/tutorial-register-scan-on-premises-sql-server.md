# Tutorial: Register and scan an on-premises SQL Server

Azure Purview is designed to connect to data sources to help you manage sensitive data, simplify data discovery, and ensure right use. Azure Purview can connect to sources across your entire landscape, including multi-cloud and on-premises. For this scenario, you'll use a self-hosted integration runtime to connect to data on an on-premises SQL server. Then you'll use Azure Purview to scan and classify that data.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Sign in to the Azure Purview Studio.
> * Create a collection in Azure Purview.
> * Create a self-hosted integration runtime.
> * Store credentials in an Azure Key Vault.
> * Register an on-premises SQL Server to Azure Purview.
> * Scan the SQL Server.
> * Browse your data catalog to view assets in your SQL Server.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/quick-create-portal.md).
- An Azure Purview account. If you don't already have one, you can [follow our quickstart guide to create one](create-catalog-portal.md).
- An [on-premises SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

## Sign in to Azure Purview Studio

To interact with Azure Purview, you'll connect to the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/) through the Azure portal. You can find the studio by going to your Azure Purview resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and selecting the **Open Azure Purview Studio** tile on the overview page.

## Create a collection

Collections in Azure Purview are used to organize assets and sources into a custom hierarchy for organization and discoverability. They're also the tool used to manage access across Azure Purview. In this tutorial, we'll create one collection to house your SQL Server source and all its assets. This tutorial won't cover information about assigning permissions to other users, so for more information you can follow our [Azure Purview permissions guide](catalog-permissions.md).

### Check permissions

To create and manage collections in Azure Purview, you'll need to be a **Collection Admin** within Azure Purview. We can check these permissions in the [Azure Purview Studio](use-azure-purview-studio.md).

1. Select **Data Map > Collections** from the left pane to open the collection management page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/find-collections.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, opened to the Data Map, with the Collections tab selected." border="true":::

1. Select your root collection. The root collection is the top collection in your collection list and will have the same name as your Azure Purview resource. In our example below, it is called Azure Purview Account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/select-root-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, opened to the Data Map, with the root collection highlighted." border="true":::

1. Select **Role assignments** in the collection window.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/role-assignments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, opened to the Data Map, with the role assignments tab highlighted." border="true":::

1. To create a collection, you'll need to be in the collection admin list under role assignments. If you created the Azure Purview resource, you should be listed as a collection admin under the root collection already. If not, you'll need to contact the collection admin to grant you permission.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/collection-admins.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, opened to the Data Map, with the collection admin section highlighted." border="true":::

### Create the collection

1. Select **+ Add a collection**. Again, only [collection admins](#check-permissions) can manage collections.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/select-add-a-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, showing the new collection window, with the 'add a collection' buttons highlighted." border="true":::

1. In the right panel, enter the collection name and description. If needed you can also add users or groups as collection admins to the new collection.
1. Select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/create-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, showing the new collection window, with a display name and collection admins selected, and the create button highlighted." border="true":::

1. The new collection's information will reflect on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/created-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Purview studio window, showing the newly created collection window." border="true":::

## Create a self-hosted integration runtime

The Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Purview to connect to on-premises data sources. The SHIR is downloaded and installed on a machine within the same network as the on-premises data source.

This tutorial assumes the machine where you'll install your self-hosted integration runtime can make network connections to the internet. This connection allows the SHIR to communicate between your source and Azure Purview. If your machine has a restricted firewall, or if you would like to secure your firewall, look into the [network requirements for the self-hosted integration runtime](manage-integration-runtimes.md#networking-requirements).

1. On the home page of Azure Purview Studio, select **Data Map** from the left navigation pane.

1. Under **Source management** on the left pane, select **Integration runtimes**, and then select **+ New**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/select-integration-runtime.png" alt-text="Select the Integration Runtimes button.":::

1. On the **Integration runtime setup** page, select **Self-Hosted** to create a Self-Hosted IR, and then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/select-self-hosted-ir.png" alt-text="Create new SHIR.":::

1. Enter a name for your IR, and select Create.

1. On the **Integration Runtime settings** page, follow the steps under the **Manual setup** section. You'll have to download the integration runtime from the download site onto a VM or machine that is in the same network as your on-premises SQL Server. For information about the kind of machine needed, you can follow our [guide to manage integration runtimes](manage-integration-runtimes.md#prerequisites).

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/integration-runtime-settings.png" alt-text="get key":::

   - Copy and paste the authentication key.

   - Download the self-hosted integration runtime from [Microsoft Integration Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717) on a local Windows machine. Run the installer. Self-hosted integration runtime versions such as 5.4.7803.1 and 5.6.7795.1 are supported. 

   - On the **Register Integration Runtime (Self-hosted)** page, paste one of the two keys you saved earlier, and select **Register**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/register-integration-runtime.png" alt-text="input key.":::

   - On the **New Integration Runtime (Self-hosted) Node** page, select **Finish**.

1. After the Self-hosted integration runtime is registered successfully, you'll see this window:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/successfully-registered.png" alt-text="successfully registered.":::

## Set up SQL authentication

There is only one way to set up authentication for SQL server on-premises:

- SQL Authentication

### SQL authentication

The SQL account must have access to the **master** database. This is because the `sys.databases` is in the database. The Azure Purview scanner needs to enumerate `sys.databases` in order to find all the SQL databases on the server.

#### Create a new login and user

If you would like to create a new login and user to be able to scan your SQL server, follow the steps below:

> [!Note]
> All the steps below can be executed using the code provided [here](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/blob/master/TSQL-Code-Permissions/grant-access-to-on-prem-sql-databases.sql).

1. Navigate to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), connect to the server, navigate to security, select and hold (or right-click) login and create New login. Make sure to select SQL authentication.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/create-new-login-user.png" alt-text="Create new login and user.":::

1. Select Server roles on the left navigation and ensure that public role is assigned.

1. Select User mapping on the left navigation, select all the databases in the map and select the Database role: **db_datareader**.

1. Select **OK** to save.

1. Navigate again to the user you created, by selecting and holding (or right-clicking) on the user and selecting **Properties**. Enter a new password and confirm it. Select the 'Specify old password' and enter the old password. **It's required to change your password as soon as you create a new login.**

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-register-scan-on-premises-sql-server/change-password.png" alt-text="change password.":::
