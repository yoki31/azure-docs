# FAQ about Azure Purview private endpoints

This article answers common questions that customers and field teams often ask about Azure Purview network configurations by using [Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md). It's intended to clarify questions about Azure Purview firewall settings, private endpoints, DNS configuration, and related configurations.

To set up Azure Purview by using Private Link, see [Use private endpoints for your Azure Purview account](./catalog-private-link.md).

## Common questions

Check out the answers to the following common questions.

### What's the purpose of deploying the Azure Purview account private endpoint?

The Azure Purview account private endpoint is used to add another layer of security by enabling scenarios where only client calls that originate from within the virtual network are allowed to access the account. This private endpoint is also a prerequisite for the portal private endpoint.

### What's the purpose of deploying the Azure Purview portal private endpoint?

The Azure Purview portal private endpoint provides private connectivity to Azure Purview Studio.

### What's the purpose of deploying the Azure Purview ingestion private endpoints?

Azure Purview can scan data sources in Azure or an on-premises environment by using ingestion private endpoints. Three other private endpoint resources are deployed and linked to Azure Purview managed resources when ingestion private endpoints are created:

- **Blob** is linked to an Azure Purview managed storage account.
- **Queue** is linked to an Azure Purview managed storage account.
- **namespace** is linked to an Azure Purview managed event hub namespace.

### Can I scan data through a public endpoint if a private endpoint is enabled on my Azure Purview account?

Yes. Data sources that aren't connected through a private endpoint can be scanned by using a public endpoint while Azure Purview is configured to use a private endpoint.

### Can I scan data through a service endpoint if a private endpoint is enabled?

Yes. Data sources that aren't connected through a private endpoint can be scanned by using a service endpoint while Azure Purview is configured to use a private endpoint.

Make sure you enable **Allow trusted Microsoft services** to access the resources inside the service endpoint configuration of the data source resource in Azure. For example, if you're going to scan Azure Blob Storage in which the firewalls and virtual networks settings are set to **selected networks**, make sure the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account** checkbox is selected as an exception.

### Can I access Azure Purview Studio from a public network if Public network access is set to Deny in Azure Purview account networking?

No. Connecting to Azure Purview from a public endpoint where **Public network access** is set to **Deny** results in the following error message:

"Not authorized to access this Azure Purview account. This Azure Purview account is behind a private endpoint. Please access the account from a client in the same virtual network (VNet) that has been configured for the Azure Purview account's private endpoint."

In this case, to open Azure Purview Studio, either use a machine that's deployed in the same virtual network as the Azure Purview portal private endpoint or use a VM that's connected to your CorpNet in which hybrid connectivity is allowed.

### Is it possible to restrict access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace (for private endpoint ingestion only) but keep portal access enabled for users across the web?

No. When you set **Public network access** to **Deny**, access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is automatically set for private endpoint ingestion only. When you set **Public network access** to **Allow**, access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is automatically set for **All Networks**. You can't modify the private endpoint ingestion manually for the managed storage account or event hub namespace manually.

### If public network access is set to Allow, does it mean the managed storage account and event hub namespace can be publicly accessible?

No. As protected resources, access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is restricted to Azure Purview only. These resources are deployed with a deny assignment to all principals, which prevents any applications, users, or groups from gaining access to them.

To read more about Azure deny assignment, see [Understand Azure deny assignments](../role-based-access-control/deny-assignments.md).

### What are the supported authentication types when you use a private endpoint?

Azure Key Vault or Service Principal.

### What private DNS zones are required for Azure Purview for a private endpoint?

For Azure Purview _account_ and _portal_ private endpoints:

- `privatelink.purview.azure.com`

For Azure Purview _ingestion_ private endpoints:

- `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
- `privatelink.queue.core.windows.net`
- `privatelink.servicebus.windows.net`

### Do I have to use a dedicated virtual network and dedicated subnet when I deploy Azure Purview private endpoints?

No. However, `PrivateEndpointNetworkPolicies` must be disabled in the destination subnet before you deploy the private endpoints. Consider deploying Azure Purview into a virtual network that has network connectivity to data source virtual networks through VNet Peering and access to an on-premises network if you plan to scan data sources cross-premises.

Read more about [Disable network policies for private endpoints](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md).

### Can I deploy Azure Purview private endpoints and use existing private DNS zones in my subscription to register the A records?

Yes. Your private endpoint DNS zones can be centralized in a hub or data management subscription for all internal DNS zones required for Azure Purview and all data source records. We recommend this method to allow Azure Purview to resolve data sources by using their private endpoint internal IP addresses.

You're also required to set up a [virtual network link](../dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links.md) for virtual networks for the existing private DNS zone.

### Can I use Azure integration runtime to scan data sources through a private endpoint?

No. You have to deploy and register a self-hosted integration runtime to scan data by using private connectivity. Azure Key Vault or Service Principal must be used as the authentication method to data sources.

### What are the outbound ports and firewall requirements for virtual machines with self-hosted integration runtime for Azure Purview when you use a private endpoint?

The VMs in which self-hosted integration runtime is deployed must have outbound access to Azure endpoints and an Azure Purview private IP address through port 443.

### Do I need to enable outbound internet access from the virtual machine running self-hosted integration runtime if a private endpoint is enabled?

No. However, it's expected that the virtual machine running self-hosted integration runtime can connect to your instance of Azure Purview through an internal IP address by using port 443. Use common troubleshooting tools for name resolution and connectivity testing, such as nslookup.exe and Test-NetConnection.

### Why do I receive the following error message when I try to launch Azure Purview Studio from my machine?

"This Azure Purview account is behind a private endpoint. Please access the account from a client in the same virtual network (VNet) that has been configured for the Azure Purview account's private endpoint."

It's likely your Azure Purview account is deployed by using Private Link and public access is disabled on your Azure Purview account. As a result, you have to browse Azure Purview Studio from a virtual machine that has internal network connectivity to Azure Purview.

If you're connecting from a VM behind a hybrid network or using a jump machine connected to your virtual network, use common troubleshooting tools for name resolution and connectivity testing, such as nslookup.exe and Test-NetConnection.

1. Validate if you can resolve the following addresses through your Azure Purview account's private IP addresses.

   - `Web.Purview.Azure.com`
   - `<YourPurviewAccountName>.Purview.Azure.com`

1. Verify network connectivity to your Azure Purview account by using the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <YourPurviewAccountName>.Purview.Azure.com -Port 443
   ```

1. Verify your cross-premises DNS configuration if you use your own DNS resolution infrastructure.
