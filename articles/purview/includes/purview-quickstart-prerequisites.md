## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

* An [Azure Active Directory tenant](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) associated with your subscription.

* The user account that you use to sign in to Azure must be a member  of the *contributor* or *owner* role, or an *administrator* of the Azure subscription. To view the permissions that you have in the subscription, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your username in the upper-right corner, select the "**...**" icon for more options, and then select **My permissions**. If you have access to multiple subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription.

* No [Azure Policies](../../governance/policy/overview.md) preventing creation of **Storage accounts** or **Event Hub namespaces**. Azure Purview will deploy a managed Storage account and Event Hub when it is created. If a blocking policy exists and needs to remain in place, please follow our [Azure Purview exception tag guide](../create-azure-purview-portal-faq.md) and follow the steps to create an exception for Azure Purview accounts.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.
