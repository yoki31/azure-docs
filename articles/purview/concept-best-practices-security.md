# Azure Purview security best practices

This article provides best practices for common security requirements in Azure Purview. The security strategy described follows the layered defense-in-depth approach.

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-best-practices/security-defense-in-depth.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows defense in depth in Azure Purview." :::

Before applying these recommendations to your environment, you should consult your security team as some may not be applicable to your security requirements.

## Network security

Azure Purview is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution in Azure. You can enable the following network security capabilities for your Azure Purview accounts:

- Enable [end-to-end network isolation](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md) using Private Link Service.
- Use [Azure Purview Firewall](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md#firewalls-to-restrict-public-access) to disable Public access.
- Deploy [Network Security Group (NSG) rules](#use-network-security-groups) for subnets where Azure data sources private endpoints, Azure Purview private endpoints and self-hosted runtime VMs are deployed.
- Implement Azure Purview with private endpoints managed by a Network Virtual Appliance, such as [Azure Firewall](../firewall/overview.md) for network inspection and network filtering.

For more information, see [Best practices related to connectivity to Azure PaaS Services](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/connectivity-to-azure-paas-services).

### Deploy private endpoints for Azure Purview accounts

If you need to use Azure Purview from inside your private network, it is recommended to use Azure Private Link Service with your Azure Purview accounts for partial or [end-to-end isolation](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md) to connect to Azure Purview Studio, access Azure Purview endpoints and to scan data sources.

The Azure Purview _account_ private endpoint is used to add another layer of security, so only client calls that are originated from within the virtual network are allowed to access the Azure Purview account. This private endpoint is also a prerequisite for the portal private endpoint.

The Azure Purview _portal_ private endpoint is required to enable connectivity to Azure Purview Studio using a private network.

Azure Purview can scan data sources in Azure or an on-premises environment by using ingestion private endpoints.

- For scanning Azure _platform as a service_ data sources, review [Support matrix for scanning data sources through ingestion private endpoint](catalog-private-link.md#support-matrix-for-scanning-data-sources-through-ingestion-private-endpoint).
- If you are deploying Azure Purview with end-to-end network isolation, to scan Azure data sources, these data sources must be also configured with private endpoints.
- Review [known limitations](catalog-private-link-troubleshoot.md).

For more information, see [Azure Purview network architecture and best practices](concept-best-practices-network.md). 

### Block public access using Azure Purview firewall

You can disable Azure Purview Public access to cut off access to the Azure Purview account completely from the public internet. In this case, you should consider the following requirements:

- Azure Purview must be deployed based on [end-to-end network isolation scenario](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md).
- To access Azure Purview Studio and Azure Purview endpoints, you need to use a management machine that is connected to private network to access Azure Purview through private network.
- Review [known limitations](catalog-private-link-troubleshoot.md).
- To scan Azure platform as a service data sources, review [Support matrix for scanning data sources through ingestion private endpoint](catalog-private-link.md#support-matrix-for-scanning-data-sources-through-ingestion-private-endpoint).
- Azure data sources must be also configured with private endpoints.
- To scan data sources, you must use a self-hosted integration runtime.

For more information, see [Firewalls to restrict public access](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md#firewalls-to-restrict-public-access).

### Use Network Security Groups 

You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains [security rules](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md#security-rules) that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

Network Security Groups can be applied to network interface or Azure virtual networks subnets, where Azure Purview private endpoints, self-hosted integration runtime VMs and Azure data sources are deployed. 

For more information, see [apply NSG rules for private endpoints](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md).

The following NSG rules are required on **data sources** for Azure Purview scanning:

|Direction   |Source  |Source port range   |Destination  |Destination port   |Protocol  |Action  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Inbound     | Self-hosted integration runtime VMs' private IP addresses or subnets         |  *       | Data Sources private IP addresses or Subnets         |  443       | Any        | Allow        |


The following NSG rules are required on from the **management machines** to access Azure Purview Studio: 

|Direction   |Source  |Source port range   |Destination  |Destination port   |Protocol  |Action  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Outbound      | Management machines' private IP addresses or subnets         | *        |   Azure Purview account and portal private endpoint IP addresses or subnets      |  443       | Any        | Allow        |

The following NSG rules are required on **self-hosted integration runtime VMs** for Azure Purview scanning and metadata ingestion:

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Consider adding additional rules with relevant Service Tags, based on your data source types. 

|Direction   |Source  |Source port range   |Destination  |Destination port   |Protocol  |Action  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Outbound     | Self-hosted integration runtime VMs' private IP addresses or subnets         | *        | Data Sources private IP addresses or subnets         |  443       | Any        | Allow         |

|Outbound     | Self-hosted integration runtime VMs' private IP addresses or subnets         | *        | Service tag: `KeyVault`         |  443       | Any        | Allow        |


The following NSG rules are required on for **Azure Purview account, portal and ingestion private endpoints**:

|Direction   |Source  |Source port range   |Destination  |Destination port   |Protocol  |Action  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Inbound     | Self-hosted integration runtime VMs' private IP addresses or subnets       | *        | Azure Purview account and ingestion private endpoint IP addresses or subnets        |  443       | Any        | Allow        |
|Inbound     | Management machines' private IP addresses or subnets        | *        | Azure Purview account and ingestion private endpoint IP addresses or subnets         |  443       | Any        | Allow        |

For more information, see [Self-hosted integration runtime networking requirements](manage-integration-runtimes.md#networking-requirements).

## Access management

Identity and Access Management provides the basis of a large percentage of security assurance. It enables access based on identity authentication and authorization controls in cloud services. These controls protect data and resources and decide which requests should be permitted.

Related to roles and access management in Azure Purview, you can apply the following security best practices:

- Define roles and responsibilities to manage Azure Purview in control plane and data plane:
  - Define roles and tasks required to deploy and manage Azure Purview inside an Azure subscription.
  - Define roles and task needed to perform data management and governance using Azure Purview.  
- Assign roles to Azure Active Directory groups instead of assigning roles to individual users.
- Use Azure [Active Directory Entitlement Management](../active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview.md) to map user access to Azure AD groups using Access Packages. 
- Enforce multi-factor authentication for Azure Purview users, especially, for users with privileged roles such as collection admins, data source admins or data curators.

### Manage an Azure Purview account in control plane and data plane

Control plane refers to all operations related to Azure deployment and management of Azure Purview inside Azure Resource Manager.  

Data plane refers to all operations, related to interacting with Azure Purview inside Data Map and Data Catalog.

You can assign control plane and data plane roles to users, security groups and service principals from your Azure Active Directory tenant that is associated to Azure Purview instance's Azure subscription. 

Examples of control plane operations and data plane operations: 

|Task  |Scope  |Recommended role  |What roles to use?  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Deploy an Azure Purview account     | Control plane         | Azure subscription owner or contributor         | Azure RBAC roles         |
|Set up a Private Endpoint for Azure Purview     | Control plane         | Contributor         | Azure RBAC roles        |
|Delete an Azure Purview account      | Control plane         | Contributor         | Azure RBAC roles        |
|View Azure Purview metrics to get current capacity units       | Control plane         | Reader       | Azure RBAC roles        |
|Create a collection      | Data plane           | Collection Admin        | Azure Purview roles        |
|Register a data source    | Data plane          | Collection Admin         | Azure Purview roles         |
|Scan a SQL Server      | Data plane          | Data source admin and data reader or data curator          | Azure Purview roles         |
|Search inside Azure Purview Data Catalog      | Data plane          | Data source admin and data reader or data curator          | Azure Purview roles         |

Azure Purview plane roles are defined and managed inside Azure Purview instance in Azure Purview collections. For more information, see [Access control in Azure Purview](catalog-permissions.md#roles). 

Follow [Azure role-based access recommendations](../role-based-access-control/best-practices.md) for Azure control plane tasks.

### Authentication and authorization

To gain access to Azure Purview, users must be authenticated and authorized. Authentication is the process of proving the user is who they claim to be. Authorization refers to controlling access inside Azure Purview assigned on collections. 

We use Azure Active Directory to provide authentication and authorization mechanisms for Azure Purview inside Collections. You can assign Azure Purview roles to the following security principals from your Azure Active Directory tenant that is associated with Azure subscription where your Azure Purview instance is hosted: 

- Users and guest users (if they are already added into your Azure AD tenant) 
- Security groups 
- Managed Identities  
- Service Principals 

Azure Purview fine-grained roles can be assigned to a flexible Collections hierarchy inside the Azure Purview instance.

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-best-practices/security-access-management.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Azure Purview access management."lightbox="media/concept-best-practices/security-access-management.png":::

### Define Least Privilege model 

As a general rule, restrict access based on the [need to know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know) and [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) security principles is imperative for organizations that want to enforce security policies for data access. 

In Azure Purview, data sources, assets and scans can be organized using [Azure Purview Collections](quickstart-create-collection.md). Collections are hierarchical grouping of metadata in Azure Purview, but at the same time they provide a mechanism to manage access across Azure Purview. Roles in Azure Purview can be assigned to a collection based on your collection's hierarchy. 

Use [Azure Purview collections](concept-best-practices-collections.md#define-a-collection-hierarchy) to implement your organization's metadata hierarchy for centralized or delegated management and governance hierarchy based on least privileged model. 

Follow least privilege access model when assigning roles inside Azure Purview collections by segregating duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. 

For more information how to assign least privilege access model in Azure Purview, based on Azure Purview collection hierarchy, see [Access control in Azure Purview](catalog-permissions.md#assign-permissions-to-your-users).

### Lower exposure of privileged accounts 

Securing privileged access is a critical first step to protecting business assets. Minimizing the number of people who have access to secure information or resources, reduces the chance of a malicious user getting access, or an authorized user inadvertently affecting a sensitive resource.  

Reduce the number of users with write access inside your Azure Purview instance. Keep the number of collection admins and data curator roles minimum at root collection.  

### Use multi-factor authentication and conditional access 

[Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication](../active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md) provides another layer of security and authentication. For more security, we recommend enforcing [conditional access policies](../active-directory/conditional-access/overview.md) for all privileged accounts.  

By using Azure Active Directory Conditional Access policies, apply Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication at sign-in for all individual users who are assigned to Azure Purview roles with modify access inside your Azure Purview instances: Collection Admin, Data Source Admin, Data Curator. 

Enable multi-factor authentication for your admin accounts and ensure that admin account users have registered for MFA. 

You can define your Conditional Access policies by selecting Azure Purview as a Cloud App. 

### Prevent accidental deletion of Azure Purview accounts 

In Azure, you can apply [resource locks](../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md) to an Azure subscription, a resource group, or a resource to prevent accidental deletion or modification for critical resources.

Enable Azure resource lock for your Azure Purview accounts to prevent accidental deletion of Azure Purview instances in your Azure subscriptions.

Adding a `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly` lock to Azure Purview account does not prevent deletion or modification operations inside Azure Purview data plane, however, it prevents any operations in control plane, such as deleting the Azure Purview account, deploying a private endpoint or configuration of diagnostic settings. 

For more information, see [Understand scope of locks](../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md#understand-scope-of-locks).

Resource locks can be assigned to Azure Purview resource groups or resources, however, you cannot assign an Azure resource lock to Azure Purview Managed resources or managed Resource Group.

### Implement a break glass strategy
Plan for a break glass strategy for your Azure Active Directory tenant, Azure subscription and Azure Purview accounts to prevent tenant-wide account lockout.

For more information about Azure AD and Azure emergency access planning, see [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](../active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access.md).

For more information about Azure Purview break glass strategy, see [Azure Purview collections best practices and design recommendations](concept-best-practices-collections.md#design-recommendations).


## Threat protection and preventing data exfiltration 

Azure Purview provides rich insights into the sensitivity of your data, which makes it valuable to security teams using Microsoft Defender for Cloud to manage the organization's security posture and protect against threats to their workloads. Data resources remain a popular target for malicious actors, making it crucial for security teams to identify, prioritize, and secure sensitive data resources across their cloud environments. To address this challenge, we're announcing the integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Purview in public preview.

### Integrate with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Defender for Cloud 

Often, one of the biggest challenges for security organization in a company is to identify and protect assets based on their criticality and sensitivity. Microsoft recently [announced integration between Azure Purview and Microsoft Defender for Cloud in Public Preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-purview-blog/what-s-new-in-azure-purview-at-microsoft-ignite-2021/ba-p/2915954) to help overcome these challenges. 

If you have extended your Microsoft 365 sensitivity labels for assets and database columns in Azure Purview, you can keep track of highly valuable assets using Microsoft Defender for Cloud from inventory, alerts and recommendations based on assets detected sensitivity labels. 

- For recommendations, we've provided **security controls** to help you understand how important each recommendation is to your overall security posture. Defender for Cloud includes a **secure score** value for each control to help you prioritize your security work. Learn more in [Security controls and their recommendations](../defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls.md#security-controls-and-their-recommendations).

- For alerts, we've assigned **severity labels** to each alert to help you prioritize the order in which you attend to each alert. Learn more in [How are alerts classified?](../defender-for-cloud/alerts-overview.md#how-are-alerts-classified).

For more information, see [Integrate Azure Purview with Azure security products](how-to-integrate-with-azure-security-products.md). 

## Information Protection 

### Secure metadata extraction and storage

Azure Purview is a data governance solution in cloud. You can register and scan different data sources from various data systems from your on-premises, Azure, or multi-cloud environments into Azure Purview. While data source is registered and scanned in Azure Purview, the actual data and data sources stay in their original locations, only metadata is extracted from data sources and stored in Azure Purview Data Map, which means you do not need to move data out of the region or their original location to extract the metadata into Azure Purview.

When an Azure Purview account is deployed, in addition, a managed resource group is also deployed in your Azure subscription. A managed Azure Storage Account and a Managed Event Hubs are deployed inside this resource group. The managed storage account is used to ingest metadata from data sources during the scan. Since these resources are consumed by the Azure Purview they cannot be accessed by any other users or principals, except the Azure Purview account. This is because an Azure role-based access control (RBAC) deny assignment is added automatically for all principals to this resource group at the time of Azure Purview account deployment, preventing any CRUD operations on these resources if they are not initiated from Azure Purview.

### Where is metadata stored? 

Azure Purview extracts only the metadata from different data source systems into [Azure Purview Data Map](concept-elastic-data-map.md) during the scanning process. 

You can deploy an Azure Purview account inside your Azure subscription in any [supported Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=purview&regions=all).  

All metadata is stored inside Data Map inside your Azure Purview instance. This means the metadata is stored in the same region as your Azure Purview instance. 

### How metadata is extracted from data sources? 

Azure Purview allows you to use any of the following options to extract metadata from data sources: 

- **Azure runtime**. Metadata data is extracted and processed inside the same region as your data sources. 

  :::image type="content" source="media/concept-best-practices/security-azure-runtime.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the connection flow between Azure Purview, the Azure runtime, and data sources."lightbox="media/concept-best-practices/security-azure-runtime.png":::

  1. A manual or automatic scan is initiated from the Azure Purview data map through the Azure integration runtime. 
   
  2. The Azure integration runtime connects to the data source to extract metadata.

  3. Metadata is queued in Azure Purview managed storage and stored in Azure Blob Storage. 

  4. Metadata is sent to the Azure Purview data map. 

- **Self-hosted integration runtime**. Metadata is extracted and processed by self-hosted integration runtime inside self-hosted integration runtime VMs' memory before they are sent to Azure Purview Data Map. In this case, customers have to deploy and manage one or more self-hosted integration runtime Windows-based virtual machines inside their Azure subscriptions or on-premises environments. Scanning on-premises and VM-based data sources always requires using a self-hosted integration runtime. The Azure integration runtime is not supported for these data sources. The following steps show the communication flow at a high level when you're using a self-hosted integration runtime to scan a data source.

  :::image type="content" source="media/concept-best-practices/security-self-hosted-runtime.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the connection flow between Azure Purview, a self-hosted runtime, and data sources."lightbox="media/concept-best-practices/security-self-hosted-runtime.png":::

  1. A manual or automatic scan is triggered. Azure purview connects to Azure Key Vault to retrieve the credential to access a data source.
   
  2. The scan is initiated from the Azure Purview data map through a self-hosted integration runtime. 
   
  3. The self-hosted integration runtime service from the VM connects to the data source to extract metadata.

  4. Metadata is processed in VM memory for the self-hosted integration runtime. Metadata is queued in Azure Purview managed storage and then stored in Azure Blob Storage. 

  5. Metadata is sent to the Azure Purview data map. 

  If you need to extract metadata from data sources with sensitive data that cannot leave the boundary of your on-premises network, it is highly recommended to deploy the self-hosted integration runtime VM inside your corporate network, where data sources are located, to extract and process metadata in on-premises, and send only metadata to Azure Purview.  

  :::image type="content" source="media/concept-best-practices/security-self-hosted-runtime-on-premises.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the connection flow between Azure Purview, an on-premises self-hosted runtime, and data sources in on-premises network."lightbox="media/concept-best-practices/security-self-hosted-runtime-on-premises.png":::

  1. A manual or automatic scan is triggered. Azure purview connects to Azure Key Vault to retrieve the credential to access a data source.
   
  2. The scan is initiated through the on-premises self-hosted integration runtime.
   
  3. The self-hosted integration runtime service from the VM connects to the data source to extract metadata.

  4. Metadata is processed in VM memory for the self-hosted integration runtime. Metadata is queued in Azure Purview managed storage and then stored in Azure Blob Storage. Actual data never leaves the boundary of your network.

  5. Metadata is sent to the Azure Purview data map. 

### Information protection and encryption 

Azure offers many mechanisms for keeping data private in rest and as it moves from one location to another. For Azure Purview, data is encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys and when data is in transit, using Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2 or greater.

#### Transport Layer Security (Encryption-in-transit)

Data in transit (also known as data in motion) is always encrypted in Azure Purview. 

To add another layer of security in addition to access controls, Azure Purview secures customer data by encrypting data in motion with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and protect data in transit against 'out of band' attacks (such as traffic capture). It uses encryption to make sure attackers can't easily read or modify the data. 

Azure Purview supports data encryption in transit with Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2 or greater. 

For more information, see, [Encrypt sensitive information in transit](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/purview-security-baseline#dp-4-encrypt-sensitive-information-in-transit).

#### Transparent data encryption (Encryption-at-rest) 

Data at rest includes information that resides in persistent storage on physical media, in any digital format. The media can include files on magnetic or optical media, archived data, and data backups inside Azure regions.

To add another layer of security in addition to access controls, Azure Purview encrypts data at rest to protect against 'out of band' attacks (such as accessing underlying storage). 
It uses encryption with Microsoft-managed keys. This practice helps make sure attackers can't easily read or modify the data. 

For more information, see [Encrypt sensitive data at rest](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/purview-security-baseline#dp-5-encrypt-sensitive-data-at-rest). 

## Credential management

To extract metadata from a data source system into Azure Purview Data Map, it is required to register and scan the data source systems in Azure Purview Data Map. To automate this process, we have made available [connectors](azure-purview-connector-overview.md) for different data source systems in Azure Purview to simplify the registration and scanning process.

To connect to a data source Azure Purview requires a credential with read-only access to the data source system.  

It is recommended prioritizing the use of the following credential options for scanning, when possible: 

1. Azure Purview Managed Identity 
2. User Assigned Managed Identity 
3. Service Principals
4. Other options such as Account key, SQL Authentication, etc.  

If you use any options rather than managed identities, all credentials must be stored and protected inside an [Azure key vault](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account). Azure Purview requires get/list access to secret on the Azure Key Vault resource. 

As a general rule, you can use the following options to set up integration runtime and credentials to scan data source systems: 

|Scenario  |Runtime option   |Supported Credentials   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Data source is an Azure Platform as a Service, such as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 or Azure SQL inside public network      | Option 1: Azure Runtime          | Azure Purview Managed Identity, Service Principal or Access Key / SQL Authentication (depending on Azure data source type)         |
|Data source is an Azure Platform as a Service, such as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 or Azure SQL inside public network      | Option 2: Self-hosted integration runtime          | Service Principal or Access Key / SQL Authentication (depending on Azure data source type)         |
|Data source is an Azure Platform as a Service, such as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 or Azure SQL inside private network using Azure Private Link Service      |  Self-hosted integration runtime         | Service Principal or Access Key / SQL Authentication (depending on Azure data source type)         |
|Data source is inside an Azure IaaS VM such as SQL Server       | Self-hosted integration runtime deployed in Azure         | SQL Authentication or Basic Authentication (depending on Azure data source type)         |
|Data source is inside an on-premises system such as SQL Server or Oracle      | Self-hosted integration runtime deployed in Azure or in the on-premises network        | SQL Authentication or Basic Authentication (depending on Azure data source type)         |
|Multi-cloud      | Azure runtime or self-hosted integration runtime based on data source types          |  Supported credential options vary based on data sources types       |
|Power BI tenant    | Azure Runtime          | Azure Purview Managed Identity         |

Use [this guide](azure-purview-connector-overview.md) to read more about each connector and their supported authentication options.

## Other recommendations

### Define required number of Azure Purview accounts for your organization

As part of security planning for implementation of Azure Purview in your organization, review your business and security requirements to define [how many Azure Purview accounts are needed](concept-best-practices-accounts.md) in your organization. various factors may impact the decision, such as [multi-tenancy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/enterprise-enrollment-and-azure-ad-tenants#define-azure-ad-tenants) billing or compliance requirements. 

### Apply security best practices for Self-hosted runtime VMs

Consider securing the deployment and management of self-hosted integration runtime VMs in Azure or your on-premises environment, if self-hosted integration runtime is used to scan data sources in Azure Purview.  

For self-hosted integration runtime VMs deployed as virtual machines in Azure, follow [security best practices recommendations for Windows virtual machines](../virtual-machines/security-recommendations.md).

- Lock down inbound traffic to your VMs using Network Security Groups and [Azure Defender access Just-in-Time](../defender-for-cloud/just-in-time-access-usage.md).
- Install antivirus or antimalware.  
- Deploy Azure Defender to get insights around any potential anomaly on the VMs. 
- Limit the amount of software in the self-hosted integration runtime VMs. Although it is not a mandatory requirement to have a dedicated VM for a self-hosted runtime for Azure Purview, we highly suggest using dedicated VMs especially for production environments. 
- Monitor the VMs using [Azure Monitor for VMs](../azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview.md). By using Log analytics agent, you can capture content such as performance metrics to adjust required capacity for your VMs. 
- By integrating virtual machines with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can you prevent, detect, and respond to threats.
- Keep your machines current. You can enable Automatic Windows Update or use [Update Management in Azure Automation](../automation/update-management/overview.md) to manage operating system level updates for the OS. 
- Use multiple machines for greater resilience and availability. You can deploy and register multiple self-hosted integration runtimes to distribute the scans across multiple self-hosted integration runtime machines or deploy the self-hosted integration runtime on a Virtual Machine Scale Set for higher redundancy and scalability. 
- Optionally, you can plan to enable Azure backup from your self-hosted integration runtime VMs to increase the recovery time of a self-hosted integration runtime VM if there is a VM level disaster.
