# Connect to and manage Azure Files in Azure Purview

This article outlines how to register Azure Files, and how to authenticate and interact with Azure Files in Azure Purview. For more information about Azure Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | No | Limited** |

\** Lineage is supported if dataset is used as a source/sink in [Data Factory Copy activity](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) 

Azure Files supports full and incremental scans to capture the metadata and classifications, based on system default and custom classification rules.

For file types such as csv, tsv, psv, ssv, the schema is extracted when the following logics are in place:

1. First row values are non-empty
2. First row values are unique
3. First row values are neither a date nor a number

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Azure Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.
