## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Azure Purview insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

- Set up your Azure resources and populated the relevant accounts with test data

- Set up and completed a scan on the test data in each data source. For more information, see [Manage data sources in Azure Purview](manage-data-sources.md) and [Create a scan rule set](create-a-scan-rule-set.md).

- Signed in to Azure Purview with account with a [Data Reader or Data Curator role](catalog-permissions.md#roles).

For more information, see [Manage data sources in Azure Purview](manage-data-sources.md).

## Use Azure Purview classification insights

In Azure Purview, classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify data of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning.

Azure Purview uses the same sensitive information types as Microsoft 365, allowing you to stretch your existing security policies and protection across your entire data estate.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have scanned your source types, give **Classification** Insights a couple of hours to reflect the new assets.

**To view classification insights:**

1. Go to the **Azure Purview** [instance screen in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/purviewportal) and select your Azure Purview account.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Azure Purview Studio** tile.

1. In Azure Purview, select the **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: menu item on the left to access your **Insights** area.

1. In the **Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: area, select **Classification** to display the Azure Purview **Classification insights** report.
