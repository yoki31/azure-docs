* First row values are unique
* First row values are not a date or a number

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Azure Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

## Register

This section will enable you to register the Azure Blob storage account and set up an appropriate authentication mechanism to ensure successful scanning of the data source.

### Steps to register

It is important to register the data source in Azure Purview prior to setting up a scan for the data source.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to the **Azure Purview accounts** page and select your _Purview account_

## Scan

### Authentication for a scan

In order to have access to scan the data source, an authentication method in the Azure Blob Storage account needs to be configured.

The following options are supported:

> [!Note]
> If you have firewall enabled for the storage account, you must use managed identity authentication method when setting up a scan.

- **System-assigned managed identity (Recommended)** - As soon as the Azure Purview Account is created, a system-assigned managed identity (SAMI) is created automatically in Azure AD tenant. Depending on the type of resource, specific RBAC role assignments are required for the Azure Purview SAMI to perform the scans.

- **User-assigned managed identity** (preview) - Similar to a system-managed identity, a user-assigned managed identity (UAMI) is a credential resource that can be used to allow Azure Purview to authenticate against Azure Active Directory. For more information, you can see our [User-assigned managed identity guide](manage-credentials.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).

- **Account Key** - Secrets can be created inside an Azure Key Vault to store credentials in order to enable access for Azure Purview to scan data sources securely using the secrets. A secret can be a storage account key, SQL login password, or a password.

   > [!Note]
   > If you use this option, you need to deploy an _Azure key vault_ resource in your subscription and assign _Azure Purview accountâ€™s_ SAMI with required access permission to secrets inside _Azure key vault_.

- **Service Principal** - In this method, you can create a new or use an existing service principal in your Azure Active Directory tenant.

#### Using a system or user assigned managed identity for scanning

It is important to give your Azure Purview account the permission to scan the Azure Blob data source. You can add access for the SAMI or UAMI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what level scan permission is needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have firewall enabled for the storage account, you must use **managed identity** authentication method when setting up a scan.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a managed identity on an Azure resource.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find either the subscription, resource group, or resource (for example, an Azure Blob storage account) that you would like to allow the catalog to scan.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-storage-acct.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the storage account":::

1. Select **Access Control (IAM)** in the left navigation and then select **+ Add** --> **Add role assignment**

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-access-control.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the access control for the storage account":::

1. Set the **Role** to **Storage Blob Data Reader** and enter your _Azure Purview account name_ or _[user-assigned managed identity](manage-credentials.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity)_ under **Select** input box. Then, select **Save** to give this role assignment to your Azure Purview account.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-assign-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details to assign permissions for the Azure Purview account":::

1. Go into your Azure Blob storage account in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Navigate to **Security + networking > Networking**

1. Choose **Selected Networks** under **Allow access from**

1. In the **Exceptions** section, select **Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account** and hit **Save**

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the exceptions to allow trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account":::

> [!Note]
> For more details, please see steps in [Authorize access to blobs and queues using Azure Active Directory](../storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory.md)

#### Using Account Key for scanning

When authentication method selected is **Account Key**, you need to get your access key and store in the key vault:

1. Navigate to your Azure Blob storage account
1. Select **Security + networking > Access keys**

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-access-keys.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the access keys in the storage account":::

1. Copy your *key* and save it separately for the next steps

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the access keys to be copied":::

1. Navigate to your key vault

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-key-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the key vault":::

1. Select **Settings > Secrets** and select **+ Generate/Import**

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-generate-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the key vault option to generate a secret":::

1. Enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *key* from your storage account

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-secret-values.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the key vault option to enter the secret values":::

1. Select **Create** to complete

1. If your key vault is not connected to Azure Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the key to set up your scan

#### Using Service Principal for scanning

##### Creating a new service principal

If you need to [Create a new service principal](./create-service-principal-azure.md), it is required to register an application in your Azure AD tenant and provide access to Service Principal in your data sources. Your Azure AD Global Administrator or other roles such as Application Administrator can perform this operation.

##### Getting the Service Principal's Application ID

1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** present in the **Overview** of the [_Service Principal_](./create-service-principal-azure.md) already created

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-sp-appln-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Application (client) ID for the Service Principal":::

##### Granting the Service Principal access to your Azure Blob account

It is important to give your service principal the permission to scan the Azure Blob data source. You can add access for the service principal at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what level scan access is needed.

> [!Note]
> You need to be an owner of the subscription to be able to add a service principal on an Azure resource.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find either the subscription, resource group, or resource (for example, an Azure Blob Storage storage account) that you would like to allow the catalog to scan.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source/register-blob-storage-acct.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the storage account":::

## Access policy

Access policies allow data owners to manage access to datasets from Azure Purview. Owners can monitor and manage data use from within the Azure Purview Studio, without directly modifying the storage account where the data is housed.

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

To create an access policy for an Azure Storage account, follow the guidelines below.

[!INCLUDE [Azure Storage specific pre-requisites](./includes/access-policies-prerequisites-storage.md)]

### Create an access policy

Now that youâ€™ve prepared your storage account and environment for access policies, you can follow one of these configuration guides to create your policies:

- [Single storage account](./tutorial-data-owner-policies-storage.md) - This guide will allow you to enable access policies on a single storage account in your subscription.
- [All sources in a subscription or resource group](./tutorial-data-owner-policies-resource-group.md) - This guide will allow you to enable access policies on all enabled and available sources in a resource group, or across an Azure subscription.
