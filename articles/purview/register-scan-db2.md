# Connect to and manage Db2 in Azure Purview (Preview)

This article outlines how to register Db2, and how to authenticate and interact with Db2 in Azure Purview. For more information about Azure Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | No | No| [Yes](#lineage)|

The supported IBM Db2 versions are Db2 for LUW 9.7 to 11.x. Db2 for z/OS (mainframe) and iSeries (AS/400) are not supported now. 

When scanning IBM Db2 source, Azure Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Server
    - Databases
    - Schemas
    - Tables including the columns, foreign keys, indexes, and constraints
    - Views including the columns
    - Triggers

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among tables and views.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire Db2 database, or scope the scan to a subset of schemas matching the given name(s) or name pattern(s).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Azure Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md). The minimal supported Self-hosted Integration Runtime version is 5.12.7984.1.

* Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) is installed on the virtual machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed.

* Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

* Manually download a Db2 JDBC driver from [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/db2-jdbc-driver-versions-and-downloads) onto your virtual machine where self-hosted integration runtime is running.

    > [!Note]
    > The driver should be accessible to all accounts in the VM. Do not install it in a user account.

* The Db2 user must have the CONNECT permission. Azure Purview connects to the syscat tables in IBM Db2 environment when importing metadata.

## Register

This section describes how to register Db2 in Azure Purview using the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Steps to register

To register a new Db2 source in your data catalog, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Azure Purview account in the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register**
1. On Register sources, select **Db2**. Select **Continue**.

On the **Register sources (Db2)** screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the **Server** name to connect to a Db2 source. This can either be:
    * A host name used to connect to the database server. For example: `MyDatabaseServer.com`
    * An IP address. For example: `192.169.1.2`
    * Its fully qualified JDBC connection string. For example:

        ```
        jdbc:db2://COMPUTER_NAME_OR_IP:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
        ```

1. Enter the **Port** used to connect to the database server (446 by default for Db2).

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

1. Finish to register the data source.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan Db2 to automatically identify assets and classify your data. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

### Authentication for a scan

The supported authentication type for a Db2 source is **Basic authentication**.

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. In the Management Center, select Integration runtimes. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it is not set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to create a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered Db2 source.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured self-hosted integration runtime

    1. **Credential**: Select the credential to connect to your data source. Make sure to:
        * Select **Basic Authentication** while creating a credential.
        * Provide the user name used to connect to the database server in the User name input field.
        * Store the user password used to connect to the database server in the secret key.

    1. **Database**: The name of the database instance to import.    
    
    1. **Schema**: List subset of schemas to import expressed as a semicolon separated list. For example, `schema1; schema2`. All user schemas are imported if that list is empty. All system schemas (for example, SysAdmin) and objects are ignored by default.

        Acceptable schema name patterns using SQL LIKE expressions syntax include using %. For example: `A%; %B; %C%; D`
        * Start with A or
        * End with B or
        * Contain C or
        * Equal D

        Usage of NOT and special characters are not acceptable.

    1. **Driver location**: Specify the path to the JDBC driver location in your VM where self-host integration runtime is running. This should be the path to valid JAR folder location.

        > [!Note]
        > The driver should be accessible to all accounts in the VM. Please do not install in a user account.

    1. **Maximum memory available**: Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of Db2 source to be scanned.

        > [!Note]
        > As a thumb rule, please provide 1GB memory for every 1000 tables

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-db2/scan.png" alt-text="scan Db2" border="true":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and Run**.

## Lineage

After scanning your Db2 source, you can [browse data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md) or [search data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) to view the asset details. 

Go to the asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset relationship when applicable. Refer to the [supported capabilities](#supported-capabilities) section on the supported Db2 lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see [data lineage](concept-data-lineage.md) and [lineage user guide](catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).
