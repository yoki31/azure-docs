# Custom classifications in Azure Purview

This article describes how you can create custom classifications to define data types in your data estate that are unique to your organization. It also describes the creation of custom classification rules that let you find specified data throughout your data estate.

## Default system classifications

The Azure Purview Data Catalog provides a large set of default system classifications that represent typical personal data types that you might have in your data estate. For the entire list of available system classifications, see [Supported classifications in Azure Purview](supported-classifications.md).

You also have the ability to create custom classifications, if any of the default classifications don't meet your needs.

> [!Note]
> Our [data sampling rules](sources-and-scans.md#sampling-within-a-file) are applied to both system and custom classifications.  

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Purview custom classifications are applied only to structured data sources like SQL and CosmosDB, and to structured file types like CSV, JSON, and Parquet. Custom classification isn't applied to unstructured data file types like DOC, PDF, and XLSX.

## Steps to create a custom classification

To create a custom classification, follow these steps:

1. From your catalog, select **Data Map** from the left menu.

2. Select **Classifications** under **Annotation management**.

3. Select **+ New**

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/new-classification.png" alt-text="New classification" border="true":::

The **Add new classification** pane opens, where you can give your
classification a name and a description. It's good practice to use a name-spacing convention, such as `your company name.classification name`.

The Microsoft system classifications are grouped under the reserved `MICROSOFT.` namespace. An example is **MICROSOFT.GOVERNMENT.US.SOCIAL\_SECURITY\_NUMBER**.

The name of your classification must start with a letter followed by a sequence of letters, numbers, and period (.) or underscore characters. No spaces are allowed. As you type, the UX automatically generates a friendly name. This friendly name is what users see when you apply it to an asset in the catalog.

To keep the name short, the system creates the friendly name based on
the following logic:

- All but the last two segments of the namespace are trimmed.

- The casing is adjusted so that the first letter of each word is capitalized.

- All underscores (\_) are replaced with spaces.

As an example, if you named your classification **CONTOSO.HR.EMPLOYEE\_ID**, the friendly name is stored
in the system as **Hr.Employee ID**.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/contoso-hr-employee-id.png" alt-text="Contoso.hr.employee_id" border="true":::

Select **OK**, and your new classification is added to your
classification list.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/custom-classification.png" alt-text="Custom classification" border="true":::

Selecting the classification in the list opens the classification
details page. Here, you find all the details about the classification.

These details include the count of how many instances there are, the formal name, associated classification rules (if any), and the owner name.

## Custom classification rules

The catalog service provides a set of default classification rules, which are used by the scanner to automatically detect certain data types. You can also add your own custom classification rules to detect other types of data that you might be interested in finding across your data estate. This capability can be powerful when you're trying to find data within your data estate.

As an example, let\'s say that a company named Contoso has employee IDs that are standardized throughout the company with the word \"Employee\" followed by a GUID to create EMPLOYEE{GUID}. For example, one instance of an employee ID looks like `EMPLOYEE9c55c474-9996-420c-a285-0d0fc23f1f55`.

Contoso can configure the scanning system to find instances of these IDs by creating a custom classification rule. They can supply a regular expression that matches the data pattern, in this
case, `\^Employee\[A-Za-z0-9\]{8}-\[A-Za-z0-9\]{4}-\[A-Za-z0-9\]{4}-\[A-Za-z0-9\]{4}-\[A-Za-z0-9\]{12}\$`. Optionally,
if the data usually is in a column that they know the name of, such as Employee\_ID or EmployeeID, they can add a column pattern regular expression to make the scan even more accurate. An example regex is Employee\_ID\|EmployeeID.

The scanning system can then use this rule to examine the actual data in the column and the column name to try to identify every instance of where the employee ID pattern is found.

## Steps to create a custom classification rule

To create a custom classification rule:

1. Create a custom classification by following the instructions in the previous section. You will add this custom classification in the classification rule configuration so that the system applies it when it finds a match in the column.

2. Select the **Data Map** icon.

3. Select the **Classifications rules** section.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/classification-rules.png" alt-text="Classification rules tile" border="true":::

4. Select **New**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/new-classification-rule.png" alt-text="Add new classification rule" border="true":::

5. The **New classification rule** dialog box opens. Fill in the fields and decide whether to create a **regular expression rule** or a **dictionary rule**.

   |Field     |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Name   |    Required. The maximum is 100 characters.    |
   |Description      |Optional. The maximum is 256 characters.    |
   |Classification Name    | Required. Select the name of the classification from the drop-down list to tell the scanner to apply it if a match is found.        |
   |State   |  Required. The options are enabled or disabled. Enabled is the default.    |

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/create-new-classification-rule.png" alt-text="Create new classification rule" border="true":::

### Creating a Regular Expression Rule

1. If creating a regular expression rule, you will see the following screen. You may optionally upload a file that will be used to **generate suggested regex patterns** for your rule.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/create-new-regex-rule.png" alt-text="Create new regex rule" border="true":::

1. If you decide to generate a suggested regex pattern, after uploading a file, select one of the suggested patterns and select **Add to Patterns** to use the suggested data and column patterns. You can tweak the suggested patterns or you may also type your own patterns without uploading a file.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/suggested-regex.png" alt-text="Generate suggested regex" border="true":::

   |Field     |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Data Pattern    |Optional. A regular expression that represents the data that's stored in the data field. The limit is very large. In the previous example, the data patterns test for an employee ID that's literally the word `Employee{GUID}`.  |
   |Column Pattern    |Optional. A regular expression that represents the column names that you want to match. The limit is very large. |

1. Under **Data Pattern** you can use the **Minimum match threshold** to set the minimum percentage of the distinct data value matches in a column that must be found by the scanner for the classification to be applied. The suggested value is 60%. If you specify multiple data patterns, this setting is disabled and the value is fixed at 60%.

   > [!Note]
   > The Minimum match threshold must be at least 1%.

1. You can now verify your rule and **create** it.
1. Test the classification rule before completing the creation process to validate that it will apply tags to your assets. The classifications in the rule will be applied to the sample data uploaded just as it would in a scan. This means all of the system classifications and your custom classification will be matched to the data in your file.

   Input files may include delimited files (CSV, PSV, SSV, TSV), JSON, or XML content. The content will be parsed based on the file extension of the input file. Delimited data may have a file extension that matches any of the mentioned types. For example, TSV data can exist in a file named MySampleData.csv. Delimited content must also have a minimum of 3 columns.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/test-rule-uploaded-file-result-screen.png" alt-text="View applied classifications after uploading a test file" border="true":::

### Creating a Dictionary Rule

1. If creating a dictionary rule, you will see the following screen. Upload a file that contains all possible values for the classification you're creating in a single column.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/dictionary-rule.png" alt-text="Create dictionary rule" border="true":::

1. After the dictionary is generated, you can adjust the minimum match threshold and submit the rule.

## Next steps

Now that you've created your classification rule, it's ready to be added to a scan rule set so that your scan uses the rule when scanning. For more information, see [Create a scan rule set](create-a-scan-rule-set.md).
