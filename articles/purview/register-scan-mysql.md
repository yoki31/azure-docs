# Connect to and manage MySQL in Azure Purview (Preview)

This article outlines how to register MySQL, and how to authenticate and interact with MySQL in Azure Purview. For more information about Azure Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | No | No| [Yes](#lineage)|

The supported MySQL server versions are 5.7 to 8.x.

When scanning MySQL source, Azure Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Server
    - Databases
    - Tables including the columns
    - Views including the columns

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among tables and views.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire MySQL server, or scope the scan to a subset of databases matching the given name(s) or name pattern(s).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Azure Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md). The minimal supported Self-hosted Integration Runtime version is 5.11.7953.1.

* Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) is installed on the virtual machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed.

* Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

* The MySQL user must have the SELECT, SHOW VIEW and EXECUTE permissions for each target MySQL schema that contains metadata.

## Register

This section describes how to register MySQL in Azure Purview using the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Steps to register

To register a new MySQL source in your data catalog, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Azure Purview account in the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register**
1. On Register sources, select **MySQL**. Select **Continue**.

On the **Register sources (MySQL)** screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the **Server** name to connect to a MySQL source. This can either be:
    * A host name used to connect to the database server. For example: `MyDatabaseServer.com`
    * An IP address. For example: `192.169.1.2`
    * Its fully qualified JDBC connection string. For example:

        ```
        jdbc:mysql://COMPUTER_NAME_OR_IP/DATABASE_NAME
        ```

1. Enter the **Port** used to connect to the database server (3306 by default for MySQL).

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

1. Finish to register the data source.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan MySQL to automatically identify assets and classify your data. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

### Authentication for a scan

The supported authentication type for a MySQL source is **Basic authentication**.

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. In the Management Center, select Integration runtimes. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it is not set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to create a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered MySQL source.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured self-hosted integration runtime

    1. **Credential**: Select the credential to connect to your data source. Make sure to:
        * Select **Basic Authentication** while creating a credential.
        * Provide the user name used to connect to the database server in the User name input field.
        * Store the user password used to connect to the database server in the secret key.

    1. **Database**: List subset of databases to import expressed as a semicolon separated list. For example, `database1; database2`. All user databases are imported if the list is empty. All system databases (for example, SysAdmin) are ignored by default.

        Acceptable schema name patterns using SQL LIKE expressions syntax include using %. For example: `A%; %B; %C%; D`
        * Start with A or
        * End with B or
        * Contain C or
        * Equal D

        Usage of NOT and special characters are not acceptable.

    1. **Maximum memory available**: Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of MySQL source to be scanned.

        > [!Note]
        > As a rule of thumb, please provide 1GB memory for every 1000 tables

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-mysql/scan.png" alt-text="scan MySQL" border="true":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and Run**.

## Lineage

After scanning your MySQL source, you can [browse data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md) or [search data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) to view the asset details. 

Go to the asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset relationship when applicable. Refer to the [supported capabilities](#supported-capabilities) section on the supported MySQL lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see [data lineage](concept-data-lineage.md) and [lineage user guide](catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).
