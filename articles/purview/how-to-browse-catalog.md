# Browse the Azure Purview data catalog

Searching a data catalog is a great tool for data discovery if a data consumer knows what they are looking for, but often users don't know exactly how their data estate is structured. The Azure Purview data catalog offers a browse experience that enables users to explore what data is available to them either by collection or through traversing the hierarchy of each data source in the catalog.

To access the browse experience, select “Browse assets” from the data catalog home page.

## Browse by collection

Browse by collection allows you to explore the different collections you are a data reader or curator for.

> [!NOTE]
> You will only see collections you have access to. For more information, see [create and manage Collections](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md).

Once a collection is selected, you will get a list of assets in that collection with the facets and filters available in search. As a collection can have thousands of assets, browse uses the Azure Purview search relevance engine to boost the most important assets to the top.

For certain annotations, you can click on the ellipses to choose between an AND condition or an OR condition.

If the selected collection doesn’t contain the data you are looking for, you can easily navigate to related collections or go back and view the entire collections tree.

Once you find the asset you are looking for, you can select it to view additional details such as schema, lineage, and a detailed classification list. To learn more about the asset details page, see [Manage catalog assets](catalog-asset-details.md).

## Browse by source type

Browse by source type allows data consumers to explore the hierarchies of data sources using an explorer view. Select a source type to see the list of scanned sources.

For example, you can easily find a dataset called *DateDimension* under a folder called *Dimensions* in Azure Data lake Storage Gen 2. You can use the 'Browse by source type' experience to navigate to the ADLS Gen 2 storage account, then browse to the service > container > folder(s) to reach the specific *Dimensions* folder and then see the *DateDimension* table.

A native browsing experience with hierarchical namespace is provided for each corresponding data source.

> [!NOTE]
> After a successful scoped scan, there may be delay before newly scanned assets appear in the browse experience.


1. On the **Browse by source types** page, tiles are categorized by data sources. To further explore assets in each data source, select the corresponding tile.

   > [!TIP]
   > Certain tiles are groupings of a collection of data sources. For example, the Azure Storage Account tile contains all Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts. The Azure SQL Server tile will display the Azure SQL Server assets that contain Azure SQL Database and Azure Dedicated SQL Pool instances ingested into the catalog. 

1. On the next page, top-level assets under your chosen data type are listed. Pick one of the assets to further explore its contents. For example, after selecting "Azure SQL Database", you will see a list of databases with assets in the data catalog.

1. The explorer view will open. Start browsing by selecting the asset on the left panel. Child assets will be listed on the right panel of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-browse-catalog/explorer-view.png" alt-text="Explorer view" border="true":::

1. To view the details of an asset, select the name or the ellipses button on the far right.
