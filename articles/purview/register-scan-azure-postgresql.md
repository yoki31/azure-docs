## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Azure Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Azure Purview Studio. See our [Azure Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

## Register

This section describes how to register an Azure Database for PostgreSQL in Azure Purview using the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Authentication for registration

Currently, to be able to manage and interact with an Azure Database for PostgreSQL single server, only SQL Authentication is supported.

#### SQL Authentication

Connecting to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL database requires the fully qualified server name and login credentials. You can follow the instructions in [CONNECT AND QUERY](../postgresql/connect-python.md) to create a login for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL if you don't have this available. You will need **username** and **password** for the next steps.

1. If you do not have an Azure Key vault already, follow [this guide to create an Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal.md).
1. Navigate to your key vault in the Azure portal
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *password* from your Azure PostgreSQL Database
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Azure Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) of type SQL authentication using the **username** and **password** to set up your scan

### Steps to register

1. Navigate to your Azure Purview account.

1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan an Azure Database for PostgreSQL database to automatically identify assets and classify your data. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md)

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. Select the **Data Map** tab on the left pane in the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).

1. Select the Azure Database for PostgreSQL source that you registered.

1. Select **New scan**

1. Select the credential to connect to your data source.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-postgresql/04-scope-scan.png" alt-text="Scope your scan":::

1. Then select a scan rule set. You can choose between the system default, existing custom rule sets, or create a new rule set inline.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-postgresql/05-scan-rule-set.png" alt-text="Scan rule set":::

1. Choose your scan trigger. You can set up a schedule or run the scan once.
