# Access control in Azure Purview

Azure Purview uses **Collections** to organize and manage access across its sources, assets, and other artifacts. This article describes collections and access management in your Azure Purview account.

## Collections

A collection is a tool Azure Purview uses to group assets, sources, and other artifacts into a hierarchy for discoverability and to manage access control. All accesses to Azure Purview's resources are managed from collections in the Azure Purview account itself.

> [!NOTE]
> As of November 8th, 2021, ***Insights*** is accessible to Data Curators. Data Readers do not have access to Insights.

## Roles

Azure Purview uses a set of predefined roles to control who can access what within the account. These roles are currently:

- **Collection admins** - a role for users that will need to assign roles to other users in Azure Purview or manage collections. Collection admins can add users to roles on collections where they're admins. They can also edit collections, their details, and add subcollections.
- **Data curators** - a role that provides access to the data catalog to manage assets, configure custom classifications, set up glossary terms, and view insights. Data curators can create, read, modify, move, and delete assets. They can also apply annotations to assets.
- **Data readers** - a role that provides read-only access to data assets, classifications, classification rules, collections and glossary terms.
- **Data source admins** - a role that allows a user to manage data sources and scans. If a user is granted only to **Data source admin** role on a given data source, they can run new scans using an existing scan rule. To create new scan rules, the user must be also granted as either **Data reader** or **Data curator** roles.

## Who should be assigned to what role?

|User Scenario|Appropriate Role(s)|
|-------------|-----------------|
|I just need to find assets, I don't want to edit anything|Data Reader|
|I need to edit information about assets, assign classifications, associate them with glossary entries, and so on.|Data Curator|
|I need to edit the glossary or set up new classification definitions|Data Curator|
|I need to view Insights to understand the governance posture of my data estate|Data Curator|
|My application's Service Principal needs to push data to Azure Purview|Data Curator|
|I need to set up scans via the Azure Purview Studio|Data Curator on the collection **or** Data Curator **And** Data Source Administrator where the source is registered|
|I need to enable a Service Principal or group to set up and monitor scans in Azure Purview without allowing them to access the catalog's information |Data Source Admin|
|I need to put users into roles in Azure Purview | Collection Admin |

## Understand how to use Azure Purview's roles and collections

All access control is managed in Azure Purview's collections. Azure Purview's collections can be found in the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/). Open your Azure Purview account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the Azure Purview Studio tile on the Overview page. From there, navigate to the data map on the left menu, and then select the 'Collections' tab.

When an Azure Purview account is created, it starts with a root collection that has the same name as the Azure Purview account itself. The creator of the Azure Purview account is automatically added as a Collection Admin, Data Source Admin, Data Curator, and Data Reader on this root collection, and can edit and manage this collection.

Sources, assets, and objects can be added directly to this root collection, but so can other collections. Adding collections will give you more control over who has access to data across your Azure Purview account.

All other users can only access information within the Azure Purview account if they, or a group they're in, are given one of the above roles. This means, when you create an Azure Purview account, no one but the creator can access or use its APIs until they are [added to one or more of the above roles in a collection](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-role-assignments).

Users can only be added to a collection by a collection admin, or through permissions inheritance. The permissions of a parent collection are automatically inherited by its subcollections. However, you can choose to [restrict permission inheritance](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#restrict-inheritance) on any collection. If you do this, its subcollections will no longer inherit permissions from the parent and will need to be added directly, though collection admins that are automatically inherited from a parent collection can't be removed.

You can assign Azure Purview roles to users, security groups and service principals from your Azure Active Directory that is associated with your purview account's subscription.

## Assign permissions to your users

After creating an Azure Purview account, the first thing to do is create collections and assign users to roles within those collections.

> [!NOTE]
> If you created your Azure Purview account using a service principal, to be able to access the Azure Purview Studio and assign permissions to users, you will need to grant a user collection admin permissions on the root collection.
> You can use [this Azure CLI command](/cli/azure/purview/account#az_purview_account_add_root_collection_admin):
>
>   ```azurecli
>   az purview account add-root-collection-admin --account-name [Azure Purview Account Name] --resource-group [Resource Group Name] --object-id [User Object Id]
>   ```
> The object-id is optional. For more information and an example, see the [CLI command reference page](/cli/azure/purview/account#az_purview_account_add_root_collection_admin).

### Create collections

Collections can be customized for structure of the sources in your Azure Purview account, and can act like organized storage bins for these resources. When you're thinking about the collections you might need, consider how your users will access or discover information. Are your sources broken up by departments? Are there specialized groups within those departments that will only need to discover some assets? Are there some sources that should be discoverable by all your users?

This will inform the collections and subcollections you may need to most effectively organize your data map.

New collections can be added directly to the data map where you can choose their parent collection from a drop-down, or they can be added from the parent as a sub collection. In the data map view, you can see all your sources and assets ordered by the collections, and in the list, the source's collection is listed.

For more instructions and information, you can follow our [guide for creating and managing collections](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md).

#### A collections example

Now that we have a base understanding of collections, permissions, and how they work, let's look at an example.

:::image type="content" source="./media/catalog-permissions/collection-example.png" alt-text="Chart showing a sample collections hierarchy broken up by region and department." border="true":::

This is one way an organization might structure their data: Starting with their root collection (Contoso, in this example) collections are organized into regions, and then into departments and subdepartments. Data sources and assets can be added to any one these collections to organize data resources by these regions and department, and manage access control along those lines. There's one subdepartment, Revenue, that has strict access guidelines, so permissions will need to be tightly managed.

The [data reader role](#roles) can access information within the catalog, but not manage or edit it. So for our example above, adding the Data Reader permission to a group on the root collection and allowing inheritance will give all users in that group reader permissions on Azure Purview sources and assets. This makes these resources discoverable, but not editable, by everyone in that group. [Restricting inheritance](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#restrict-inheritance) on the Revenue group will control access to those assets. Users who need access to revenue information can be added separately to the Revenue collection.
Similarly with the Data Curator and Data Source Admin roles, permissions for those groups will start at the collection where they're assigned and trickle down to subcollections that haven't restricted inheritance. Below we have assigned permissions for several groups at collections levels in the Americas sub collection.

### Add users to roles

Role assignment is managed through the collections. Only a user with the [collection admin role](#roles) can grant permissions to other users on that collection. When new permissions need to be added, a collection admin will access the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/), navigate to data map, then the collections tab, and select the collection where a user needs to be added. From the Role Assignments tab they will be able to add and manage users who need permissions.
