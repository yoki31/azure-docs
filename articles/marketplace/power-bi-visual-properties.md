## Legal and support info

Provide terms and conditions for your offer. You have two options:

- Use the [standard contract](#use-the-standard-contract)
- Use [your own terms and conditions](#use-your-own-terms-and-conditions) (EULA)

To learn about the standard contract, see [Standard Contract for the Microsoft commercial marketplace](standard-contract.md) or download the [Standard Contract](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178) PDF (make sure your pop-up blocker is off).

### Use the standard contract

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a standard contract you can use for your offers in the commercial marketplace. When you offer your software under the standard contract, customers only need to read and accept it one time, and you don't have to create custom terms and conditions.

1. Select the **Use the Standard Contract...** check box.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visual/use-standard-contract.png" alt-text="Illustrates the Use the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace check box.":::

1. In the **Confirmation** dialog box, select **Accept**. Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to scroll up to see it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After you publish an offer using the Standard Contract for the commercial marketplace, you can't use your own custom terms and conditions. Either offer your solution under the standard contract with optional amendments or under your own terms and conditions.

### Use your own terms and conditions

You may provide your own terms and conditions instead of using the standard contract, or use our EULA specific for Power BI visual offers. Customers must accept these terms before they can try your offer.

1. Clear the **Use the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace** check box.
1. In the **EULA** filed (see image above), enter a single web address for your terms and conditions. Or, point to the Power BI visuals contract at `https://visuals.azureedge.net/app-store/Power%20BI%20-%20Default%20Custom%20Visual%20EULA.pdf` (PDF). Either will display as an active link in AppSource.

### Privacy policy link

Enter the link (URL) to your organization's privacy policy. You are responsible for ensuring your app complies with privacy laws and regulations, and for providing a valid privacy policy.

### Support document link

This link will be visible to users on AppSource. Include http:// or https:// in the URL.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.
