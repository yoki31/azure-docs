# Create a virtual machine offer on Azure Marketplace

This article describes how to create an Azure virtual machine offer for [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/). It addresses both Windows-based and Linux-based virtual machines that contain an operating system, a virtual hard disk (VHD), and up to 16 data disks.

Before you start, [create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](create-account.md). Ensure that your account is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program.

## Before you begin

If you haven't done so yet, review [Plan a virtual machine offer](marketplace-virtual-machines.md). It will explain the technical requirements for your virtual machine and list the information and assets youâ€™ll need when you create your offer.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2166002).

1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

    [ ![Illustrates the Marketplace offers tile on the Partner Center Home page.](./media/workspaces/partner-center-home.png) ](./media/workspaces/partner-center-home.png#lightbox)

1. On the Marketplace offers page, select **+ New offer** > **Azure Virtual Machine**.

    [ ![Screenshot showing the left pane menu options and the "New offer" button.](./media/create-vm/new-offer-azure-virtual-machine-workspaces.png) ](./media/create-vm/new-offer-azure-virtual-machine-workspaces.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> After an offer is published, any edits you make to it in Partner Center appear on Azure Marketplace only after you republish the offer. Be sure to always republish an offer after making changes to it.

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the Azure Marketplace offer and in Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. The ID can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if you enter **test-offer-1**, the offer web address will be `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. The offer alias is the name that's used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name is not used on Azure Marketplace. It is different from the offer name and other values that are shown to customers.

Select **Create** to generate the offer and continue. Partner Center opens the **Offer setup** page.

## Test drive (optional)

[!INCLUDE [Test drives section](includes/test-drives.md)]

For VM offers, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployment is the only test drive option available. The deployment template must contain all the Azure resources that comprise your solution.

To enable a test drive, select the **Enable a test drive** check box; this will enable a Test drive tab in the left-nav menu. You will configure and create the listing of your test drive using that tab later in [Configure a VM test drive](azure-vm-test-drive.md).

With test drive, configuring a CRM for customer leads is required (see next section). To remove test drive from your offer, clear this check box.

## Customer leads

[!INCLUDE [Customer leads](includes/customer-leads.md)]

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Properties**.
