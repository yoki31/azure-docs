# Azure Consumption Commitment enrollment

This article is for commercial marketplace publishers and describes Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC), a contractual commitment customers make with Microsoft for specific amounts of Azure spend over time. For information about how MACC benefits customers, see [Azure Consumption Commitment benefit](/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit).

> [!TIP]
> To see the customer's view of consumption commitment benefits in Azure Marketplace, see [Azure consumption commitment benefit](/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit).

## MACC program

The _Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)_ program is for [transactable offers](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md#transact-overview) that are published to Azure Marketplace. Azure Marketplace purchases of transactable offers that are enrolled in this program contribute towards an organizationâ€™s Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment.

### Requirements for an offer to be enrolled in MACC

An offer must meet the following requirements to be enrolled in the MACC program:

- Transactable with a pricing plan greater than $0  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Free and BYOL (bring your own license) offers are NOT considered transactable.
- Azure IP Co-sell Incentivized
- Published live in Azure Marketplace

## How to see if your offer is enrolled in the MACC program

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

> [!NOTE]
> MACC program status for offers published to Azure Marketplace is updated weekly on Mondays. This means that if you publish an offer that meets the eligibility requirements for the MACC program, the status in Partner Center will not show the Enrolled status until the following Monday.
