# Create plans for a Managed Service offer

Managed Service offers sold through the Microsoft commercial marketplace must have at least one plan. You can create a variety of plans with different options within the same offer. These plans (sometimes referred to as SKUs) can differ in terms of version, monetization, or tiers of service. For detailed guidance on plans, see [Plans and pricing for commercial marketplace offers](./plans-pricing.md).

## Create a plan

1. On the **Plan overview** tab of your offer in Partner Center, select **+ Create new plan**.
2. In the dialog box that appears, under **Plan ID**, enter a unique plan ID. Use up to 50 lowercase alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores. You cannot modify the plan ID after you select **Create**. This ID will be visible to your customers.
3. In the **Plan name** box, enter a unique name for this plan. Use a maximum of 50 characters. This name will be visible to your customers.
4. Select **Create**.

## Define the plan listing

On the **Plan listing** tab, define the plan name and description as you want them to appear in the commercial marketplace.

1. The **Plan name** box displays the name you provided earlier for this plan. You can change it at any time. This name will appear in the commercial marketplace as the title of your offer's plan.
2. In the **Plan summary** box, provide a short description of your plan, which may be used in marketplace search results.
3. In the **Plan description** box, explain what makes this plan unique and different from other plans within your offer.
4. Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab.

## Define pricing and availability

The only pricing model available for Managed Service offers is **Bring your own license (BYOL)**. This means that you bill your customers directly for costs related to this offer, and Microsoft doesn’t charge you any fees.

You can configure each plan to be visible to everyone (public) or to only a specific audience (private).

> [!NOTE]
> Private plans are not supported with subscriptions established through a reseller of the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once a plan has been published as public, you can't change it to private. To control which customers can accept your offer and delegate resources, use a private plan. With a public plan, you can't restrict availability to certain customers or even to a certain number of customers (although you can stop selling the plan completely if you choose to do so). You can remove access to a delegation after a customer accepts an offer only if you included an Authorization with the Role Definition set to Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role when you published the offer. You can also reach out to the customer and ask them to remove your access.

## Make your plan public

1. Under **Plan visibility**, select **Public**.
2. Select **Save draft**. To return to the Plan overview tab, select **Plan overview** in the upper left.
3. To create another plan for this offer, select **+ Create new plan** in the **Plan overview** tab.

## Make your plan private

You grant access to a private plan using Azure subscription IDs. You can add a maximum of 10 subscription IDs manually or up to 10,000 subscription IDs using a .CSV file.

To add up to 10 subscription IDs manually:

1. Under **Plan visibility**, select **Private**.
2. Enter the Azure subscription ID of the audience you want to grant access to.
3. Optionally, enter a description of this audience in the **Description** box.
4. To add another ID, select **Add ID (Max 10)**.
5. When you’re done adding IDs, select **Save draft**.

To add up to 10,000 subscription IDs with a .CSV file:

1. Under **Plan visibility**, select **Private**.
2. Select the **Export Audience (csv)** link. This will download a .CSV file.
3. Open the .CSV file. In the **Id** column, enter the Azure subscription IDs you want to grant access to.
4. In the **Description** column, you have the option to add a description for each entry.
5. In the **Type** column, add **SubscriptionId** to each row that has an ID.
6. Save the file as a .CSV file.
7. In Partner Center, select the **Import Audience (csv)** link.
8. In the **Confirm** dialog box, select **Yes**, then upload the .CSV file.
9. Select **Save draft**.

## Technical configuration

This section creates a manifest with authorization information for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user accounts. This information is required in order to enable access to the customer's resources through [Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/overview.md).

Review [Tenants, roles, and users in Azure Lighthouse scenarios](../lighthouse/concepts/tenants-users-roles.md#best-practices-for-defining-users-and-roles) to understand which roles are supported and the best practices for defining your authorizations.

> [!NOTE]
> The users and roles in your Authorization entries will apply to every customer who activates the plan. If you want to limit access to a specific customer, you'll need to publish a private plan for their exclusive use.

### Manifest

1. Under **Manifest**, provide a **Version** for the manifest. Use the format n.n.n (for example, 1.2.5).
2. Enter your **Tenant ID**. This is a GUID associated with the Azure AD tenant ID of your organization; that is, the managing tenant from which you will access your customers' resources. If you don't have this handy, you can find it by hovering over your account name on the upper right-hand side of the Azure portal, or by selecting **Switch directory**.

If you publish a new version of your offer and need to create an updated manifest, select **+ New manifest**. Be sure to increase the version number from the previous manifest version.

### Authorizations

Authorizations define the entities in your managing tenant who can access resources and subscriptions for customers who purchase the plan. Each of these entities is assigned a built-in role that grants specific levels of access.

You can create up to 20 authorizations for each plan.

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, you'll want to assign roles to an Azure AD user group or service principal, rather than to a series of individual user accounts. This lets you add or remove access for individual users without having to update and republish the plan when your access requirements change. When assigning roles to Azure AD groups, the [group type](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md) should be Security and not Office 365. For additional recommendations, see [Tenants, roles, and users in Azure Lighthouse scenarios](../lighthouse/concepts/tenants-users-roles.md).

Provide the following information for each **Authorization**. Select **+ Add authorization** as needed to add more users and role definitions.

- **Display Name**: A friendly name to help the customer understand the purpose of this authorization. The customer will see this name when delegating resources.
- **Principal ID**: The Azure AD identifier of a user, user group, or service principal that will be granted certain permissions (as defined by the **Role** you specify) to your customers' resources.
- **Access type**:
  - **Active** authorizations have the privileges assigned to the role at all times. Each plan must have at least one Active authorization.
  - **Eligible** authorizations are time-limited and require activation by the user.  If you select **Eligible**, you must select a maximum duration that defines the total length of time for which the user will have the eligible role after it's activated. The minimum value is 30 minutes and the maximum is 8 hours. You can also select whether to require multifactor authentication in order to activate the role. Note that eligible authorizations are currently in public preview and have specific licensing requirements. For more information, see [Create eligible authorizations](../lighthouse/how-to/create-eligible-authorizations.md).
- **Role**: Select one of the available Azure AD built-in roles from the list. This role will determine the permissions that the user in the **Principal ID** field will have on your customers' resources. For descriptions of these roles, see [Built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) and [Role support for Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/concepts/tenants-users-roles.md#role-support-for-azure-lighthouse).
  > [!NOTE]
  > As applicable new built-in roles are added to Azure, they will become available here, although there may be some delay before they appear.
- **Assignable Roles**: This option will appear only if you have selected User Access Administrator in the **Role Definition** for this authorization. If so, you must add one or more assignable roles here. The user in the **Azure AD Object ID** field will be able to assign these roles to [managed identities](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md), which is required in order to [deploy policies that can be remediated](../lighthouse/how-to/deploy-policy-remediation.md). No other permissions normally associated with the User Access Administrator role will apply to this user.
- **Approvers**: This option will appear only if the **Access type** is set to **Eligible**. If so, you can optionally specify a list of up to ten users or user groups who can [approve or deny requests from a user to activate the eligible role](../lighthouse/how-to/create-eligible-authorizations.md#approvers). Approvers will be notified when the approval is requested and has been granted. If none are provided, the authorization will activate automatically.

> [!TIP]
> To ensure you can [remove access to a delegation](../lighthouse/how-to/remove-delegation.md) if needed, include an **Authorization** with the **Role Definition** set to [Managed Services Registration Assignment Delete Role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-services-registration-assignment-delete-role). If this role is not assigned, delegated resources can only be removed by a user in the customer's tenant.

Once you've completed all of the sections for your plan, you can select **+ Create new plan** to create additional plans. When you're done, select **Save draft**. When you're done creating plans, select **Plans** in the breadcrumb trail at the top of the window to return to the left-nav menu for the offer.

## Updating an offer

After your offer is published, you can [publish an updated version of your offer](update-existing-offer.md) at any time. For example, you may want to add a new role definition to a previously published offer. When you do so, customers who have already added the offer will see an icon in the [**Service providers**](../lighthouse/how-to/view-manage-service-providers.md) page in the Azure portal that lets them know an update is available. Each customer will be able to review the changes and decide whether they want to update to the new version.

## Next steps
