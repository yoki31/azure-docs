# Microsoft preferred solution badge

> [!TIP]
> To see the customer's view of preferred solutions in the commercial marketplace, see [What is Azure Marketplace?](/marketplace/azure-marketplace-overview#microsoft-preferred-solutions) and [What is Microsoft AppSource?](/marketplace/appsource-overview).

## What is the Microsoft preferred solution badge?

The preferred solution badge is awarded as a [commercial marketplace benefit](/partner-center/co-sell-overview?context=/azure/marketplace/context/context) to:

- Offers published to the commercial marketplace with an Azure IP co-sell incentive
- Offers enrolled in the Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect program with co-sell ready status

The Microsoft preferred solution badge is visible in the online stores of the commercial marketplace: [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/home) and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/home).

## How does the badge benefit customers?

Offers with the Microsoft preferred solution badge have been validated by a team of Microsoft experts, have a focus on specific solution areas, and have proven to generate business impact, technology transformation, or cross-organizational improvements for customers. This badge allows customers browsing in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace to visually identify those offers.

## How does the badge benefit partners?

For partners, the Microsoft preferred solution badge aligns offers published to Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace to Microsoftâ€™s go-to-market priorities.

## What are the changes to the criteria to achieve the badge?

Until July 2021, publishers with at least one co-sell ready offer were eligible to receive the Microsoft preferred solution badge for all offers published to the commercial marketplace. Starting in August 2021, to improve discovery of offers that have achieved co-sell incentive status, the preferred solution badge is awarded only to offers that meet the business and technical requirements to earn an Azure IP co-sell incentive or the Business Applications co-sell incentive.  

## Next steps

- To configure an offer for co-sell, see [Configure Co-sell for a commercial marketplace offer](/partner-center/co-sell-configure?context=/azure/marketplace/context/context)
- For information about co-sell incentive status, see [Requirements for Azure IP Co-sell incentive status](/partner-center/co-sell-requirements?context=/azure/marketplace/context/context) or [Business Applications Co-sell incentive status](/partner-center/co-sell-requirements?context=/azure/marketplace/context/context)
