# Tutorial: Use Creator to create indoor maps

This tutorial describes how to create indoor maps. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Upload your indoor map Drawing package.
> * Convert your Drawing package into map data.
> * Create a dataset from your map data.
> * Create a tileset from the data in your dataset.
> * Query the Azure Maps Web Feature Service (WFS) API to learn about your map features.
> * Create a feature stateset that can be used to set the states of features in your dataset.
> * Update the state of a given map feature.

## Prerequisites

1. [Make an Azure Maps account](quick-demo-map-app.md#create-an-azure-maps-account).
2. [Obtain a primary subscription key](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account), also known as the primary key or the subscription key.
3. [Create a Creator resource](how-to-manage-creator.md).
4. Download the [Sample Drawing package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/am-creator-indoor-data-examples/blob/master/Sample%20-%20Contoso%20Drawing%20Package.zip).

This tutorial uses the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) application, but you can use a different API development environment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial uses the `us.atlas.microsoft.com` geographical URL. If your Creator service wasn't created in the United States, you must use a different geographical URL.  For more information, see [Access to Creator Services](how-to-manage-creator.md#access-to-creator-services).

## Upload a Drawing package

Use the [Data Upload API](/rest/api/maps/data-v2/upload-preview) to upload the Drawing package to Azure Maps resources.

The Data Upload API is a long running transaction that implements the pattern defined in [Creator Long-Running Operation API V2](creator-long-running-operation-v2.md).

To upload the Drawing package:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *POST Data Upload*.

4. Select the **POST** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL to the [Data Upload API](/rest/api/maps/data-v2/upload-preview) The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key)::

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapData?api-version=2.0&dataFormat=dwgzippackage&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select the **Headers** tab.

7. In the **KEY** field, select `Content-Type`.

8. In the **VALUE** field, select `application/octet-stream`.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/data-upload-header.png"alt-text="Header tab information for data upload.":::

9. Select the **Body** tab.

10. In the dropdown list, select **binary**.

11. Select **Select File**, and then select a Drawing package.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/data-upload-body.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Postman showing the body tab in the POST window, with Select File highlighted, this is used to select the Drawing package to import into Creator.":::

12. Select **Send**.

13. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab.

14. Copy the value of the **Operation-Location** key. The Operation-Location key is also known as the `status URL` and is required to check the status of the Drawing package upload, which is explained in the next section.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/data-upload-response-header.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Postman showing the header tab in the response window, with the Operation Location key highlighted.":::

### Check the Drawing package upload status

To check the status of the drawing package and retrieve its unique ID (`udid`):

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *GET Data Upload Status*.

4. Select the **GET** HTTP method.

5. Enter the `status URL` you copied as the last step in the previous section of this article. You will need to append your subscription key to the end of the URL `&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your Azure Maps primary subscription key). The request should look like the following URL:

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/operations/{operationId}?api-version=2.0&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab.

8. Copy the value of the **Resource-Location** key, which is the `resource location URL`. The `resource location URL` contains the unique identifier (`udid`) of the drawing package resource.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/resource-location-url.png" alt-text="Copy the resource location URL.":::

### (Optional) Retrieve Drawing package metadata

You can retrieve metadata from the Drawing package resource. The metadata contains information like the resource location URL, creation date, updated date, size, and upload status.

To retrieve content metadata:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *GET Data Upload Metadata*.

4. . Select the **GET** HTTP method.

5. Enter the `resource Location URL` you copied as the last step in the previous section of this article. You will need to append your subscription key to the end of the URL `&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your Azure Maps primary subscription key). The request should look like the following URL:

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/metadata/{udid}?api-version=2.0&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Body** tab. The metadata should like the following JSON fragment:

    ```json
    {
        "udid": "{udid}",
        "location": "https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/6ebf1ae1-2a66-760b-e28c-b9381fcff335?api-version=2.0",
        "created": "5/18/2021 8:10:32 PM +00:00",
        "updated": "5/18/2021 8:10:37 PM +00:00",
        "sizeInBytes": 946901,
        "uploadStatus": "Completed"
    }
    ```

## Convert a Drawing package

Now that the Drawing package is uploaded, we'll use the `udid` for the uploaded package to convert the package into map data. The Conversion API uses a long-running transaction that implements the pattern defined in the [Creator Long-Running Operation](creator-long-running-operation-v2.md) article.

To convert a Drawing package:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *POST Convert Drawing Package*.

4. Select the **POST** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL to the [Conversion Service](/rest/api/maps/v2/conversion/convert) (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key and `udid` with the `udid` of the uploaded package):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/conversions?subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}&api-version=2.0&udid={udid}&inputType=DWG&outputOntology=facility-2.0
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab.

8. Copy the value of the **Operation-Location** key, which is the `status URL`. We'll use the `status URL` to check the status of the conversion.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/data-convert-location-url.png" border="true" alt-text="Copy the value of the location key for drawing package.":::

### Check the Drawing package conversion status

After the conversion operation completes, it returns a `conversionId`. We can access the `conversionId` by checking the status of the Drawing package conversion process. The `conversionId` can then be used to access the converted data.

To check the status of the conversion process and retrieve the `conversionId`:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *GET Conversion Status*.

4. Select the **GET** HTTP method:

5. Enter the `status URL` you copied in [Convert a Drawing package](#convert-a-drawing-package). The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/conversions/operations/{operationId}?api-version=2.0&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab.

8. Copy the value of the **Resource-Location** key, which is the `resource location URL`. The `resource location URL` contains the unique identifier (`conversionId`), which can be used by other APIs to access the converted map data.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/data-conversion-id.png" alt-text="Copy the conversion ID.":::

The sample Drawing package should be converted without errors or warnings. However, if you receive errors or warnings from your own Drawing package, the JSON response includes a link to the [Drawing error visualizer](drawing-error-visualizer.md). You can use the Drawing Error visualizer to inspect the details of errors and warnings. To receive recommendations to resolve conversion errors and warnings, see [Drawing conversion errors and warnings](drawing-conversion-error-codes.md).

The following JSON fragment displays a sample conversion warning:

```json
{
    "operationId": "{operationId}",
    "created": "2021-05-19T18:24:28.7922905+00:00",
    "status": "Succeeded",
     "warning": {
        "code": "dwgConversionProblem",
        "details": [
            {
                "code": "warning",
                "details": [
                    {
                        "code": "manifestWarning",
                        "message": "Ignoring unexpected JSON property: unitProperties[0].nonWheelchairAccessible with value False"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "properties": {
        "diagnosticPackageLocation": "https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapData/ce61c3c1-faa8-75b7-349f-d863f6523748?api-version=1.0"
    }
}
```

## Create a dataset

A dataset is a collection of map features, such as buildings, levels, and rooms. To create a dataset, use the [Dataset Create API](/rest/api/maps/v2/dataset/create). The Dataset Create API takes the `conversionId` for the converted Drawing package and returns a `datasetId` of the created dataset.

To create a dataset:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *POST Dataset Create*.

4. Select the **POST** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL to the [Dataset API](/rest/api/maps/v2/dataset). The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key, and `{conversionId`} with the `conversionId` obtained in [Check Drawing package conversion status](#check-the-drawing-package-conversion-status)):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/datasets?api-version=2.0&conversionId={conversionId}&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab. 

8. Copy the value of the **Operation-Location** key, which is the `status URL`. We'll use the `status URL` to check the status of the dataset.

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *GET Dataset Status*.

4. Select the **GET** HTTP method.

5. Enter the `status URL` you copied in [Create a dataset](#create-a-dataset). The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/datasets/operations/{operationId}?api-version=2.0&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab. The value of the **Resource-Location** key is the `resource location URL`. The `resource location URL` contains the unique identifier (`datasetId`) of the dataset.

8. Copy the `datasetId`, because you'll use it in the next sections of this tutorial.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/dataset-id.png" alt-text="Copy the dataset ID.":::

## Create a tileset

A tileset is a set of vector tiles that render on the map. Tilesets are created from existing datasets. However, a tileset is independent from the dataset from which it was sourced. If the dataset is deleted, the tileset continues to exist.

To create a tileset:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *POST Tileset Create*.

4. Select the **POST** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL to the [Tileset API](/rest/api/maps/v2/tileset). The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key), and `{datasetId`} with the `datasetId` obtained in [Check dataset creation status](#check-the-dataset-creation-status):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/tilesets?api-version=2.0&datasetID={datasetId}&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. In the response window, select the **Headers** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/tileset-id.png" alt-text="Copy the tileset ID.":::

## Query datasets with WFS API

Datasets can be queried using [WFS API](/rest/api/maps/v2/wfs). You can use the WFS API to query for all feature collections or a specific collection. In this section of the tutorial, we'll do both. First we'll query all collections, and then we will query for the `unit` collection.

### Query for feature collections

To query the all collections in your dataset:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *GET Dataset Collections*.

4. Select the **GET** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL to [WFS API](/rest/api/maps/v2/wfs). The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key), and `{datasetId`} with the `datasetId` obtained in [Check dataset creation status](#check-the-dataset-creation-status):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/wfs/datasets/{datasetId}/collections?subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}&api-version=2.0
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. The response body is returned in GeoJSON format and contains all collections in the dataset. For simplicity, the example here only shows the `unit` collection. To see an example that contains all collections, see [WFS Describe Collections API](/rest/api/maps/v2/wfs/collection-description). To learn more about any collection, you can select any of the URLs inside the `link` element.

    ```json
    {
    "collections": [
        {
            "name": "unit",
            "description": "A physical and non-overlapping area which might be occupied and traversed by a navigating agent. Can be a hallway, a room, a courtyard, etc. It is surrounded by physical obstruction (wall), unless the is_open_area attribute is equal to true, and one must add openings where the obstruction shouldn't be there. If is_open_area attribute is equal to true, all the sides are assumed open to the surroundings and walls are to be added where needed. Walls for open areas are represented as a line_element or area_element with is_obstruction equal to true.",
            "links": [
                {
                    "href": "https://atlas.microsoft.com/wfs/datasets/{datasetId}/collections/unit/definition?api-version=1.0",
                    "rel": "describedBy",
                    "title": "Metadata catalogue for unit"
                },
                {
                    "href": "https://atlas.microsoft.com/wfs/datasets/{datasetId}/collections/unit/items?api-version=1.0",
                    "rel": "data",
                    "title": "unit"
                }
                {
                    "href": "https://atlas.microsoft.com/wfs/datasets/{datasetId}/collections/unit?api-version=1.0",
                    "rel": "self",
                    "title": "Metadata catalogue for unit"
                }
            ]
        },
    ```

### Query for unit feature collection

In this section, we'll query [WFS API](/rest/api/maps/v2/wfs) for the `unit` feature collection.

To query the unit collection in your dataset:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *GET Unit Collection*.

4. Select the **GET** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key, and `{datasetId`} with the `datasetId` obtained in [Check dataset creation status](#check-the-dataset-creation-status)):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/wfs/datasets/{datasetId}/collections/unit/items?subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}&api-version=2.0
    ```

6. Select **Send**.

7. After the response returns, copy the feature `id` for one of the `unit` features. In the following example, the feature `id` is "UNIT26". In this tutorial, you'll use "UNIT26" as your feature `id` when you [Update a feature state](#update-a-feature-state).

    ```json
    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [
            {
                "type": "Feature",
                "geometry": {
                    "type": "Polygon",
                    "coordinates": ["..."]
                },
                "properties": {
                    "original_id": "b7410920-8cb0-490b-ab23-b489fd35aed0",
                    "category_id": "CTG8",
                    "is_open_area": true,
                    "navigable_by": [
                        "pedestrian"
                    ],
                    "route_through_behavior": "allowed",
                    "level_id": "LVL14",
                    "occupants": [],
                    "address_id": "DIR1",
                    "name": "157"
                },
                "id": "UNIT26",
                "featureType": ""
            }, {"..."}
        ]
    }
    ```

## Create a feature stateset

Feature statesets define dynamic properties and values on specific features that support them. In this section, we'll create a stateset that defines boolean values and corresponding styles for the **occupancy** property.

To create a stateset:

1. In the Postman app, select **New**.

2. In the **Create New** window, select **HTTP Request**.

3. Enter a **Request name** for the request, such as *POST Create Stateset*.

4. Select the **POST** HTTP method.

5. Enter the following URL to the [Stateset API](/rest/api/maps/v2/feature-state/create-stateset). The request should look like the following URL (replace `{Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}` with your primary subscription key, and `{datasetId`} with the `datasetId` obtained in [Check the dataset creation status](#check-the-dataset-creation-status)):

    ```http
    https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/featurestatesets?api-version=2.0&datasetId={datasetId}&subscription-key={Your-Azure-Maps-Primary-Subscription-key}
    ```

6. Select the **Headers** tab.

7. In the **KEY** field, select `Content-Type`.

8. In the **VALUE** field, select `application/json`.

9. Select the **Body** tab.

10. In the dropdown lists, select **raw** and **JSON**.

11. Copy the following JSON styles, and then paste them in the **Body** window:

    ```json
    {
       "styles":[
          {
             "keyname":"occupied",
             "type":"boolean",
             "rules":[
                {
                   "true":"#FF0000",
                   "false":"#00FF00"
                }
             ]
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

12. Select **Send**.

13. After the response returns successfully, copy the `statesetId` from the response body. In the next section, we'll use the `statesetId` to change the `occupancy` property state of the unit with feature `id` "UNIT26".

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-creator-indoor-maps/response-stateset-id.png"alt-text="Stateset ID response.":::

12. Select **Send**.

13. After the update completes, you'll receive a `200 OK` HTTP status code. If you implemented [dynamic styling](indoor-map-dynamic-styling.md) for an indoor map, the update displays at the specified time stamp in your rendered map.

You can use the [Feature Get Stateset API](/rest/api/maps/v2/feature-state/get-states) to retrieve the state of a feature using its feature `id`. You can also use the [Feature State Delete State API](/rest/api/maps/v2/feature-state/delete-stateset) to delete the stateset and its resources.
