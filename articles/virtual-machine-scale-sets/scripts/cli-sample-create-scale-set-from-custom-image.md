## Sample reference

This script uses the commands outlined in the following table:

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/ad/group#az-ad-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) | Creates an Azure virtual machine. |
| [az sig create](/cli/azure/sig#az-sig-create) | Creates a shared image gallery. |
| [az sig image-definition create](/cli/azure/sig/image-definition#az-sig-image-definition-create) | Creates a gallery image definition. |
| [az sig image-version create](/cli/azure/sig/image-version#az-sig-image-version-create) | Create a new image version. |
| [az vmss create](/cli/azure/vmss) | Creates the virtual machine scale set and connects it to the virtual network, subnet, and network security group. A load balancer is also created to distribute traffic to multiple VM instances. This command also specifies the VM image to be used and administrative credentials.  |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/ad/group) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
