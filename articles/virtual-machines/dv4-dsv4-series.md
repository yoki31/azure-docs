# Dv4 and Dsv4-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Dv4 and Dsv4-series run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. It features an all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz, [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) and [Intel&reg; Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html). They also support [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html).

## Dv4-series

Dv4-series sizes run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake). The Dv4-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory and remote storage options for most production workloads. Dv4-series VMs feature [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html).


Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium storage disks, use the Dsv4 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Dsv4 sizes are the same as Dv4-series.

> [!NOTE]
> After a restart, a file named *Data_loss_warning.txt* might be appear beside drive C (the first data disk attached from the Azure portal). In this scenario, despite the file name, no data loss has occurred on the disk. In general, the *Data_loss_warning.txt* file usually is copied on the temporary drive. If you're using a VM that doesn't have a temp drive, WindowsAzureGuestAgent incorrectly copies the file to the first drive letter. In v4 VMs, the first drive letter is a data disk.
>
> A resolution for this issue was applied in the latest version (version 2.7.41491.999) of the VM agent.
