# Ddv4 and Ddsv4-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Ddv4 and Ddsv4-series run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. It features an all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz, [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) and [Intel&reg; Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html). They also support [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These new VM sizes will have 50% larger local storage, as well as better local disk IOPS for both read and write compared to the [Dv3/Dsv3](./dv3-dsv3-series.md) sizes with [Gen2 VMs](./generation-2.md).

D-series use cases include enterprise-grade applications, relational databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.

## Ddv4-series

Ddv4-series sizes run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake). The Ddv4-series offer a combination of vCPU, memory and temporary disk for most production workloads.

The new Ddv4 VM sizes include fast, larger local SSD storage (up to 2,400 GiB) and are designed for applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage, such as applications that require fast reads/ writes to temp storage or that need temp storage for caches or temporary files. You can attach Standard SSDs and Standard HDDs storage to the Ddv4 VMs. Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
