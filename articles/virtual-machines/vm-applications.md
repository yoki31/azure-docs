# VM Applications overview (preview)

VM Applications are a resource type in Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery) that simplifies management, sharing, and global distribution of applications for your virtual machines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **VM applications in Azure Compute Gallery** are currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).


While you can create an image of a VM with apps pre-installed, you would need to update your image each time you have application changes. Separating your application installation from your VM images means there’s no need to publish a new image for every line of code change.

Application packages provide benefits over other deployment and packaging methods:

- Grouping and versioning of your packages

- VM applications can be globally replicated to be closer to your infrastructure, so you don’t need to use AzCopy or other storage copy mechanisms to copy the bits across Azure regions.

- Sharing with other users through Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Support for virtual machines, and both flexible and uniform scale sets

- If you have Network Security Group (NSG) rules applied on your VM or scale set, downloading the packages from an internet repository might not be possible. And  with storage accounts, downloading packages onto locked-down VMs would require setting up private links.
- VM applications can be used with the [DeployIfNotExists](../governance/policy/concepts/effects.md) policy.


## What are VM app packages?

The VM application packages use multiple resource types:

| Resource | Description|
|----------|------------|
| **Azure compute gallery** | A gallery is a repository for managing and sharing application packages. Users can share the gallery resource and all the child resources will be shared automatically. The gallery name must be unique per subscription. For example, you may have one gallery to store all your OS images and another gallery to store all your VM applications.|
| **VM application** | The definition of your VM application. It is a *logical* resource that stores the common metadata for all the versions under it. For example, you may have an application definition for Apache Tomcat and have multiple versions within it. |
| **VM Application version** | The deployable resource. You can globally replicate your VM application versions to target regions closer to your VM infrastructure. The VM Application Version must be replicated to a region before it may be deployed on a VM in that region. |


## Limitations

- **No more than 3 replicas per region**: When creating a VM Application version, the maximum number of replicas per region is three. 

- **Retrying failed installations**: Currently, the only way to retry a failed installation is to remove the application from the profile, then add it back.

- **Only 5 applications per VM**: No more than 5 applications may be deployed to a VM at any point.

- **1GB application size**: The maximum file size of an application version is 1GB. 

- **No guarantees on reboots in your script**: If your script requires a reboot, the recommendation is to place that application last during deployment. While the code attempts to handle reboots, it may fail.

- **Requires a VM Agent**: The VM agent must exist on the VM and be able to receive goal states.

- **Multiple versions of same application on the same VM**: You can't have multiple versions of the same application on a VM.


## Cost

There is no extra charge for using VM Application Packages, but you will be charged for the following resources:

- Storage costs of storing each package and any replicas. 
- Network egress charges for replication of the first image version from the source region to the replicated regions. Subsequent replicas are handled within the region, so there are no additional charges. 

For more information on network egress, see [Bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/).


## VM applications

The VM application resource defines the following about your VM application:

- Azure Compute Gallery where the VM application is stored
- Name of the application
- Supported OS type like Linux or Windows
- A description of the VM application

## VM application versions

VM application versions are the deployable resource. Versions are defined with the following properties:
- Version number
- Link to the application package file in a storage account
- Install string for installing the application
- Remove string to show how to properly remove the app
- Package file name to use when it is downloaded to the VM
- Configuration file name to be used to configure the app on the VM
- A link to the configuration file for the VM application
- Update string for how to update the VM application to a newer version
- End-of-life date. End-of-life dates are informational; you will still be able to deploy a VM application versions past the end-of-life date.
- Exclude from latest. You can keep a version from being used as the latest version of the application. 
- Target regions for replication
- Replica count per region

## Download directory 
 
The download location of the application package and the configuration files are:
  
- Linux: `/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.VMApplicationManagerLinux/<appname>/<app version> `
- Windows: `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.VMApplicationManagerWindows\1.0.4\Downloads\<appname>\<app version> `


The install/update/remove commands should be written assuming the application package and the configuration file are in the current directory.

## File naming

During the preview, when the application file gets downloaded to the VM, the file name is the same as the name you use when you create the VM application. For example, if I name my VM application `myApp`, the file that will be downloaded to the VM will also be named `myApp`, regardless of what the file name is used in the storage account. If you VM application also has a configuration file, that file is the name of the application with `_config` appended. If `myApp` has a configuration file, it will be named `myApp_config`.

For example, if I name my VM application `myApp` when I create it in the Gallery, but it is stored as `myApplication.exe` in the storage account, when it gets downloaded to the VM the file name will be `myApp`. My install string should start by renaming the file to be whatever the it needs to be to run on the VM (like myApp.exe).

The install, update, and remove commands must be written with this in mind. 
 
## Command interpreter  

The default command interpreters are:
- Linux: `/bin/sh` 
- Windows: `cmd.exe`

It's possible to use a different interpreter, as long as it is installed on the machine, by calling the executable and passing the command to it. For example, to have your command run in PowerShell on Windows instead of cmd, you can pass `powershell.exe -Command '<powershell commmand>'`
  

## How updates are handled

When you update a application version, the update command you provided during deployment will be used. If the updated version doesn’t have an update command, then the current version will be removed and the new version will be installed. 

Update commands should be written with the expectation that it could be updating from any older version of the VM application.


## Tips for creating VM Applications on Linux 

3rd party applications for Linux can be packaged in a few ways. Let's explore how to handle creating the install commands for some of the most common.

### .tar and .gz files 

These are compressed archives and can simply be extracted to a desired location. Check the installation instructions for the original package to in case they need to be extracted to a specific location. If .tar.gz file contains source code, refer to the instructions for the package for how to install from source. 

Example to install command to install `golang` on a Linux machine:

```bash
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go_linux
```

Example remove command:

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

### .deb, .rpm, and other platform specific packages 
You can download individual packages for platform specific package managers, but they usually do not contain all the dependencies. For these files, you must also include all dependencies in the application package, or have the system package manager download the dependencies through the repositories that are available to the VM. If you are working with a VM with restricted internet access, you must package all the dependencies yourself.


Figuring out the dependencies can be a bit tricky. There are third party tools that can show you the entire dependency tree. 

On Ubuntu, you can run `apt-get install <name> --simulate` to show all the packages that will be installed for the `apt-get install <name>` command. Then you can use that output to download all .deb files to create an archive that can be used as the application package. The downside to this method is that is doesn't show the dependencies that are already installed on the VM.
 
Example, to create a VM application package to install PowerShell for Ubuntu, run the command `apt-get install powershell --simulate` on a new Ubuntu VM. Check the output of the line **The following NEW packages will be installed** which lists the following packages:
- `liblttng-ust-ctl4` 
- `liblttng-ust0` 
- `liburcu6` 
- `powershell`. 

Download these files using `apt-get download` and create a tar archive with all files at the root level. This tar archive will be the application package file. The install command in this case is:

```bash
tar -xf powershell && dpkg -i ./liblttng-ust-ctl4_2.10.1-1_amd64.deb ./liburcu6_0.10.1-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb ./liblttng-ust0_2.10.1-1_amd64.deb ./powershell_7.1.2-1.ubuntu.18.04_amd64.deb
```

And the remove command is:

```bash
dpkg -r powershell && apt autoremove
```

Use `apt autoremove` instead of explicitly trying to remove all the dependencies. You may have installed other applications with overlapping dependencies, and in that case, an explicit remove command would fail.


In case you don't want to resolve the dependencies yourself and apt/rpm is able to connect to the repositories, you can install an application with just one .deb/.rpm file and let apt/rpm handle the dependencies.

Example install command:

```bash
dpkg -i <appname> || apt --fix-broken install -y
```
 
## Tips for creating VM Applications on Windows 

Most 3rd party applications in Windows are available as .exe or .msi installers. Some are also available as extract and run zip files. Let us look at the best practices for each of them.


### .exe installer 

Installer executables typically launch a user interface (UI) and require someone to click through the UI. If the installer supports a silent mode parameter, it should be included in your installation string. 

Cmd.exe also expects executable files to have the extension .exe, so you need to rename the file to have the .exe extension.  

If I wanted to create a VM application package for myApp.exe, which ships as an executable, my VM Application is called 'myApp', so I write the command assuming that the application package is in the current directory:

```
"move .\\myApp .\\myApp.exe & myApp.exe /S -config myApp_config" 
```
 
If the installer executable file doesn't support an uninstall parameter you can sometimes look up the registry on a test machine to know here the uninstaller is located. 

In the registry, the uninstall string is stored in `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<installed application name>\UninstallString` so I would use the contents as my remove command:

```
'\"C:\\Program Files\\myApp\\uninstall\\helper.exe\" /S'
```

### .msi installer 

For command line execution of `.msi` installers, the commands to install or remove an application should use `msiexec`. Typically, `msiexec` runs as its own separate process and `cmd` doesn't wait for it to complete, which can lead to problems when installing more than one VM application.  The `start` command can be used with `msiexec` to ensure that the installation completes before the command returns. For example:

```
start /wait %windir%\\system32\\msiexec.exe /i myapp /quiet /forcerestart /log myapp_install.log
```

Example remove command:

```
start /wait %windir%\\system32\\msiexec.exe /x $appname /quiet /forcerestart /log ${appname}_uninstall.log
```

### Zipped files 

For .zip or other zipped files, just unzip the contents of the application package to the desired destination. 

Example install command:

```
mkdir C:\\myapp && powershell.exe -Command \"Expand-Archive -Path myapp -DestinationPath C:\\myapp\" 
```

Example remove command:

```
rmdir /S /Q C:\\myapp
```


## Troubleshooting during preview

During the preview, the VM application extension always returns a success regardless of whether any VM app failed while being installed/updated/removed. The VM Application extension will only report the extension status as failure when there is a problem with the extension or the underlying infrastructure. To know whether a particular VM application was successfully added to the VM instance, please check the message of the VMApplication extension.

To learn more about getting the status of VM extensions, see [Virtual machine extensions and features for Linux](extensions/features-linux.md#view-extension-status) and [Virtual machine extensions and features for Windows](extensions/features-windows.md#view-extension-status).

To get status of VM extensions, use [Get-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm):

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVM -name <VM name> -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Status | convertto-json -Depth 10    
```

To get status of scale set extensions, use [Get-AzVMSS](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvmss):

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVmss -name <VMSS name> -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Status | convertto-json -Depth 10  
```
