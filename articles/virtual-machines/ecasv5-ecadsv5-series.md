# ECasv5 and ECadsv5-series (preview)

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Confidential virtual machines (confidential VMs) in Azure Confidential Computing is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

The ECasv5-series and ECadsv5-series are [confidential VMs](../confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview.md) for use in Confidential Computing. 

These confidential VMs use AMD's third-Generation EPYC<sup>TM</sup> 7763v processor in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 256 MB L3 cache. This processor can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. Both series offer Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). SEV-SNP provides hardware-isolated VMs that protect data from other VMs, the hypervisor, and host management code. Confidential VMs offer hardware-based VM memory encryption. These series also offer OS disk pre-encryption before VM provisioning with different key management solutions. 

These VM series also offer a combination of vCPUs and memory to meet the requirements of most memory-intensive enterprise applications.

## ECasv5-series

ECasv5-series VMs offer a combination of vCPU and memory for memory-intensive enterprise applications. These VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads where you don't need a local temp disk. For more information, see the [FAQ for Azure VM sizes with no local temporary disk](azure-vms-no-temp-disk.yml). 

This series supports Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. Billing for disk storage and VMs is separate. To estimate your costs, use the [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

> [!NOTE]
> There are some [pricing differences based on your encryption settings](../confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview.md#encryption-pricing-differences) for confidential VMs.
