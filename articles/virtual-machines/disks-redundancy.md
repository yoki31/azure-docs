# Redundancy options for managed disks

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

Azure managed disks offer two storage redundancy options, zone-redundant storage (ZRS), and locally-redundant storage. ZRS provides higher availability for managed disks than locally-redundant storage (LRS) does. However, the write latency for LRS disks is better than ZRS disks because LRS disks synchronously write data to three copies in a single data center.

## Locally-redundant storage for managed disks

Locally-redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single data center in the selected region. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures. To protect an LRS disk from a zonal failure like a natural disaster or other issues, take the following steps:

- Use applications that can synchronously write data to two zones, and automatically failover to another zone during a disaster.
    - An example would be SQL Server AlwaysOn.
- Take frequent backups of LRS disks with ZRS snapshots.
- Enable cross-zone disaster recovery for LRS disks via [Azure Site Recovery](../site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery.md). However, cross-zone disaster recovery doesn't provide zero Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

If your workflow doesn't support application-level synchronous writes across zones, or your application must meet zero RPO, then ZRS disks would ideal.

## Zone-redundant storage for managed disks

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) synchronously replicates your Azure managed disk across three Azure availability zones in the region you select. Each availability zone is a separate physical location with independent power, cooling, and networking.

A ZRS disk lets you recover from failures in availability zones. If a zone went down, a ZRS disk can be attached to a virtual machine (VM) in a different zone. ZRS disks can also be shared between VMs for improved availability with clustered or distributed applications like SQL FCI, SAP ASCS/SCS, or GFS2. A shared ZRS disk can be attached to primary and secondary VMs in different zones to take advantage of both ZRS and [availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md). If your primary zone fails, you can quickly fail over to the secondary VM using [SCSI persistent reservation](disks-shared-enable.md#supported-scsi-pr-commands).

For more information on ZRS disks, see [Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) option for Azure Disks for high availability](https://youtu.be/RSHmhmdHXcY).

### Billing implications

For details see the [Azure pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

### Comparison with other disk types

Except for more write latency, disks using ZRS are identical to disks using LRS, they have the same scale targets. [Benchmark your disks](disks-benchmarks.md) to simulate the workload of your application and compare the latency between LRS and ZRS disks.
