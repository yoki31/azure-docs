# NCasT4_v3-series 

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The NCasT4_v3-series virtual machines are powered by [Nvidia Tesla T4](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/) GPUs and AMD EPYC 7V12(Rome) CPUs. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA T4 GPUs with 16 GB of memory each, up to 64 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC 7V12 (Rome) processor cores(base frequency of 2.45 GHz, all-cores peak frequency of 3.1 GHz and single-core peak frequency of 3.3 GHz) and 440 GiB of system memory. These virtual machines are ideal for deploying AI services- such as real-time inferencing of user-generated requests, or for interactive graphics and visualization workloads using NVIDIA's GRID driver and virtual GPU technology. Standard GPU compute workloads based around CUDA, TensorRT, Caffe, ONNX and other frameworks, or GPU-accelerated graphical applications based on OpenGL and DirectX can be deployed economically, with close proximity to users, on the NCasT4_v3 series.

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure NCasT4_v3-series VMs running Windows or Linux, Nvidia GPU drivers must be installed.

To install Nvidia GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.

The Azure Nvidia GPU driver extension will deploy CUDA drivers on the NCasT4_v3-series VMs. For graphics and visualization workloads manually install the GRID drivers supported by Azure.
