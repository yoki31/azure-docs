# Display health and monitor status of replication relationship 

You can view replication status on the source volume or the destination volume. You can also set alert rules in Azure Monitor to help you monitor the replication status.

## Display replication status

1. From either the source volume or the destination volume, select **Replication** under Storage Service for either volume.

    The following information about replication status and health is displayed:  
    * **End point type** – Identifies whether the volume is the source or destination of replication.
    * **Health** – Displays the health status of the replication relationship.
    * **Mirror state** – Shows one of the following values:
        * *Uninitialized*:  
            This is the initial and default state when a peering relationship is created. The state remains uninitialized until the initialization completes successfully.
        * *Mirrored*:   
            The destination volume has been initialized and is ready to receive mirroring updates.
        * *Broken*:   
            This is the state after you break the peering relationship. The destination volume is `‘RW’` and snapshots are present.
    * **Relationship status** – Shows one of the following values: 
        * *Idle*:  
            No transfer operation is in progress and future transfers are not disabled.
        * *Transferring*:  
            A transfer operation is in progress and future transfers are not disabled.
    * **Replication schedule** – Shows how frequently incremental mirroring updates will be performed when the initialization (baseline copy) is complete.

    * **Total progress** – Shows the total number of cumulative bytes transferred over the lifetime of the relationship. This amount is the actual bytes transferred, and it might differ from the logical space that the source and destination volumes report.

> [!NOTE] 
> Replication relationship shows health status as *unhealthy* if previous replication jobs are not complete. This status is a result of large volumes being transferred with a lower transfer window (for example, a ten-minute transfer time for a large volume). In this case, the relationship status shows *transferring* and health status shows *unhealthy*.

## Set alert rules to monitor replication

Follow the following steps to create [alert rules in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview.md) to help you monitor the status of cross-region replication:

1.	From Azure Monitor, select **Alerts**.
2.	From the Alerts window, select the **Create** dropdown and select **Create new alert rule**.
3.	From the Scope tab of the Create an Alert Rule page, select **Select scope**. The **Select a Resource** page appears.  
4.	From the Resource tab, find the **Volumes** resource type.
5.	From the Condition tab, select **Add condition**. From there, find a signal called “**is volume replication healthy**”.
6.	There you'll see **Condition of the relationship, 1 or 0** and the **Configure Signal Logic** window is displayed.
7.	To check if the replication is _unhealthy_: 
    * Set **Operator** to `Less than or equal to`.
    * Set **Aggregation type** to `Average`. 
    * Set **Threshold** value to `0`.
    * Set **Unit** to `Count`.
8.	To check if the replication is _healthy_: 
    * Set **Operator** to `Greater than or equal to`.
    * Set **Aggregation** type to `Average`.
    * Set **Threshold** value to `1`. 
    * Set **Unit** to `Count`.
9.	 Select **Review + create**. The alert rule is ready for use.
