# Mount Blob Storage by using the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol

This article provides guidance on how to mount a container in Azure Blob Storage from a Linux-based Azure virtual machine (VM) or a Linux system that runs on-premises by using the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol. To learn more about NFS 3.0 protocol support in Blob Storage, see [Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol support in Azure Blob Storage](network-file-system-protocol-support.md).

## Step 1: Create an Azure virtual network 

Your storage account must be contained within a virtual network. A virtual network enables clients to connect securely to your storage account. To learn more about Azure Virtual Network, and how to create a virtual network, see the [Virtual Network documentation](../../virtual-network/index.yml).

> [!NOTE]
> Clients in the same virtual network can mount containers in your account. You can also mount a container from a client that runs in an on-premises network, but you'll have to first connect your on-premises network to your virtual network. See [Supported network connections](network-file-system-protocol-support.md#supported-network-connections).

## Step 2: Configure network security

Currently, the only way to secure the data in your storage account is by using a virtual network and other network security settings. Any other tools used to secure data, including account key authorization, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) security, and access control lists (ACLs), are not yet supported in accounts that have the NFS 3.0 protocol support enabled on them.

To secure the data in your account, see these recommendations: [Network security recommendations for Blob storage](security-recommendations.md#networking).

## Step 3: Create and configure a storage account

To mount a container by using NFS 3.0, you must create a storage account. You can't enable existing accounts.

The NFS 3.0 protocol is supported for standard general-purpose v2 storage accounts and for premium block blob storage accounts. For more information on these types of storage accounts, see [Storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md).

To configure the account, choose these values:

|Setting | Premium performance | Standard performance
|----|---|---|
|Location|All available regions |All available regions
|Performance|Premium| Standard
|Account kind|BlockBlobStorage| General-purpose V2
|Replication|Locally-redundant storage (LRS), Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)| Locally-redundant storage (LRS), Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
|Connectivity method|Public endpoint (selected networks) or Private endpoint |Public endpoint (selected networks) or Private endpoint
|Hierarchical namespace|Enabled|Enabled
|NFS V3|Enabled |Enabled

You can accept the default values for all other settings.

## Step 4: Create a container

Create a container in your storage account by using any of these tools or SDKs:

|Tools|SDKs|
|---|---|
|[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)|[.NET](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-dotnet.md#create-a-container)|
|[AzCopy](../common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md#transfer-data)|[Java](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-java.md)|
|[PowerShell](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-powershell.md#create-a-container)|[Python](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-python.md#create-a-container)|
|[Azure CLI](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-cli.md#create-a-container)|[JavaScript](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-javascript.md)|
||[REST](/rest/api/storageservices/create-container)|

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the root squash option of a new container is **No Root Squash**. But you can change that to **Root Squash** or **All Squash**. For information about these squash options, see your operating system documentation.

The following image shows the squash options as they appear in the Azure portal.

## Step 5: Mount the container

Create a directory on your Linux system, and then mount the container in the storage account.

1. On your Linux system, create a directory:

   ```
   mkdir -p /mnt/test
   ```

2. Mount the container by using the following command:

   ```
   mount -o sec=sys,vers=3,nolock,proto=tcp <storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net:/<storage-account-name>/<container-name>  /mnt/test
   ```

   - Replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder that appears in this command with the name of your storage account.

   - Replace the `<container-name>` placeholder with the name of your container.

## Resolve common errors

|Error | Cause/resolution|
|---|---|
|`Access denied by server while mounting`|Ensure that your client is running within a supported subnet. See [Supported network locations](network-file-system-protocol-support.md#supported-network-connections).|
|`No such file or directory`| Make sure to type, rather than copy and paste, the mount command and its parameters directly into the terminal. If you copy and paste any part of this command into the terminal from another application, hidden characters in the pasted information might cause this error to appear. This error also might appear if the account isn't enabled for NFS 3.0.|
|`Permission denied`| The default mode of a newly created NFS 3.0 container is 0750. Non-root users don't have access to the volume. If access from non-root users is required, root users must change the mode to 0755. Sample command: `sudo chmod 0755 /mnt/<newcontainer>`|
|`EINVAL ("Invalid argument"`) |This error can appear when a client attempts to:<li>Write to a blob that was created from a blob endpoint.<li>Delete a blob that has a snapshot or is in a container that has an active WORM (write once, read many) policy.|
|`EROFS ("Read-only file system"`) |This error can appear when a client attempts to:<li>Write to a blob or delete a blob that has an active lease.<li>Write to a blob or delete a blob in a container that has an active WORM policy. |
|`NFS3ERR_IO/EIO ("Input/output error"`) |This error can appear when a client attempts to read, write, or set attributes on blobs that are stored in the archive access tier. |
|`OperationNotSupportedOnSymLink` error| This error can be returned during a write operation via a Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 API. Using these APIs to write or delete symbolic links that are created by using NFS 3.0 is not allowed. Make sure to use the NFS 3.0 endpoint to work with symbolic links. |
|`mount: /mnt/test: bad option;`| Install the NFS helper program by using `sudo apt install nfs-common`.|
