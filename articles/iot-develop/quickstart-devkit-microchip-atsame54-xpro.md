## Prerequisites

* A PC running Windows 10
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware

  * The [Microchip ATSAME54-XPro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails/atsame54-xpro) (Microchip E54)
  * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable
  * Wired Ethernet access
  * Ethernet cable
  * Optional: [Weather Click](https://www.mikroe.com/weather-click) sensor. You can add this sensor to the device to monitor weather conditions. If you don't have this sensor, you can still complete this quickstart.
  * Optional: [mikroBUS Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) adapter. Use this adapter to attach the Weather Click sensor to the Microchip E54. If you don't have the sensor and this adapter, you can still complete this quickstart.

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
>
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named ***get-toolchain.bat***:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```

1. Install [Microchip Studio for AVR&reg; and SAM devices](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/microchip-studio-for-avr-and-sam-devices#). Microchip Studio is a device development environment that includes the tools to program and flash the Microchip E54. For this tutorial, you use Microchip Studio only to flash the Microchip E54. The installation takes several minutes, and prompts you several times to approve the installation of components.

[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device](../../includes/iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device.md)]

## Prepare the device

To connect the Microchip E54 to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\Microchip\ATSAME54-XPRO\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    | `IOT_DPS_ID_SCOPE` | {*Your ID scope value*} |
    | `IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` | {*Your Device ID value*} |
    | `IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` | {*Your Primary key value*} |

1. Save and close the file.

### Connect the device

1. On the Microchip E54, locate the **Reset** button, the **Ethernet** port, and the Micro USB port, which is labeled **Debug USB**. Each component is highlighted in the following picture:

    ![Locate key components on the Microchip E54 evaluation kit board](media/quickstart-devkit-microchip-atsame54-xpro/microchip-xpro-board.png)

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the **Debug USB** port on the Microchip E54, and then connect it to your computer.

    > [!NOTE]

To remove the entire Azure IoT Central sample application and all its devices and resources:

1. Select **Administration** > **Your application**.
1. Select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you built a custom image that contains Azure RTOS sample code, and then flashed the image to the Microchip E54 device. You also used the IoT Central portal to create Azure resources, connect the Microchip E54 securely to Azure, view telemetry, and send messages.

As a next step, explore the following articles to learn more about using the IoT device SDKs to connect devices to Azure IoT.
