To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    > *iot-middleware-freertos-samples\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the tutorial. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version **3.20** or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```

[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device](../../includes/iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device.md)]

## Prepare the device
To connect the STM DevKit to Azure, modify configuration settings, build the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *iot-middleware-freertos-samples/demos/projects/ST/b-l475e-iot01a/config/demo_config.h*

1. Set the Wi-Fi constants to the following values from your local environment.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi ssid*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    ```shell
    cmake -G Ninja -DVENDOR=ST -DBOARD=b-l475e-iot01a -Bb-l475e-iot01a .
    cmake --build b-l475e-iot01a
    ```

2. After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

    *iot-middleware-freertos-samples\b-l475e-iot01a\demos\projects\ST\b-l475e-iot01a\iot-middleware-sample-gsg.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the STM DevKit board, locate the **Reset** button (1), the Micro USB port (2), which is labeled **USB STLink**, and the board part number (3). You will refer to these items in the next steps. All of them are highlighted in the following picture:

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-stm-b-l475e-freertos/stm-devkit-board-475.png" alt-text="Locate key components on the STM DevKit board":::

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the **USB STLINK** port on the STM DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For detailed setup information about the STM DevKit, see the instructions on the packaging, or see [B-L475E-IOT01A Resources](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html#resource)

1. In File Explorer, find the binary file named *iot-middleware-sample-gsg.bin* that you created previously.

1. In File Explorer, find the STM Devkit board that's connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label **DIS_L4IOT**.

1. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the STM Devkit. The process to flash the board starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During the process, an LED toggles between red and green on the STM DevKit.

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** app to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.

1. Start **Termite**.
    > [!TIP]
    > If you are unable to connect Termite to your devkit, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) and try again. See  [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-embedded-device-quickstarts.md) for additional steps.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your STM DevKit is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-stm-b-l475e/termite-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of serial port settings in the Termite app":::

1. Select OK.
1. Press the **Reset** button on the device. The button is black and is labeled on the device.
