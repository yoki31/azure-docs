# Connect an MXCHIP AZ3166 devkit to IoT Hub

**Applies to**: [Embedded device development](about-iot-develop.md#embedded-device-development)<br>
**Total completion time**:  30 minutes

[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/MXChip/AZ3166)

In this quickstart, you use Azure RTOS to connect an MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit (from now on, MXCHIP DevKit) to Azure IoT. 

You'll also use IoT Explorer and IoT Plug and Play to manage the MXCHIP DevKit. IoT Plug and Play provides an open device model that lets applications programmatically query a device's capabilities and interact with it. A device uses this model to broadcast its capabilities to an IoT Plug and Play-enabled application. By using this model, you can streamline and enhance the tasks of adding, configuring, and managing devices. For more information, see the [IoT Plug and Play documentation](../iot-develop/index.yml).

You'll complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming the MXChip DevKit in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the MXCHIP DevKit
* Use Azure CLI to create and manage an Azure IoT hub that the MXCHIP DevKit will securely connect to
* Use Azure IoT Explorer to register a device with your IoT hub, view device properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands on the device

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Windows 10
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Azure CLI. You have two options for running Azure CLI commands in this quickstart:
    * Use the Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell that runs CLI commands in your browser. This option is recommended because you don't need to install anything. If you're using Cloud Shell for the first time, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Follow the steps in [Cloud Shell quickstart](../cloud-shell/quickstart.md) to **Start Cloud Shell** and **Select the Bash environment**.
    * Optionally, run Azure CLI on your local machine. If Azure CLI is already installed, run `az upgrade` to upgrade the CLI and extensions to the current version. To install Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

* [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases): Cross-platform utility to  monitor and manage Azure IoT 
* Hardware

    * The [MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/AZ3166-IOT-Developer-Kit.html) (MXCHIP DevKit)
    * Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz
    * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices
resources

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```

## Create the cloud components

### Create an IoT hub

You can use Azure CLI to create an IoT hub that handles events and messaging for your device.

To create an IoT hub:

1. Launch your CLI app. To run the CLI commands in the rest of this quickstart, copy the command syntax, paste it into your CLI app, edit variable values, and press Enter.
    - If you prefer to use Cloud Shell, right-click the link for [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) and select the option to open in a new tab.
    - If you're using Azure CLI locally, start your CLI console app and sign in to Azure CLI.

1. Run [az extension add](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_add) to install or upgrade the *azure-iot* extension to the current version.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot
    ```

1. Run the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create a resource group. The following command creates a resource group named *MyResourceGroup* in the *centralus* region.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > You can optionally set an alternate `location`. To see available locations, run [az account list-locations](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list-locations).

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location centralus
    ```

1. Run the [az iot hub create](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-create) command to create an IoT hub. It might take a few minutes to create an IoT hub.

    *YourIotHubName*. Replace this placeholder below with the name you chose for your IoT hub. An IoT hub name must be globally unique in Azure. This placeholder is used in the rest of this quickstart to represent your unique IoT hub name.

    The `--sku F1` parameter creates the IoT hub in the Free tier. Free tier hubs have a limited feature set and are used for proof of concept applications. For more information on IoT Hub tiers, features, and pricing, see [Azure IoT Hub pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub). 

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name {YourIoTHubName} --sku F1 --partition-count 2
    ```

1. After the IoT hub is created, view the JSON output in the console, and copy the `hostName` value to use in a later step. The `hostName` value looks like the following example:

    `{Your IoT hub name}.azure-devices.net`

### Configure IoT Explorer

In the rest of this quickstart, you'll use IoT Explorer to register a device to your IoT hub, to view the device properties and telemetry, and to send commands to your device. In this section, you configure IoT Explorer to connect to the IoT hub you just created and to read plug and play models from the public model repository. 

To add a connection to your IoT hub:

1. In your CLI app, run the [az iot hub connection-string show](/cli/azure/iot/hub/connection-string#az_iot_hub_connection_string_show) command to get the connection string for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub connection-string  show --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. Copy the connection string without the surrounding quotation characters.
1. In Azure IoT Explorer, select **IoT hubs** on the left menu, then select **+ Add connection**.
1. Paste the connection string into the **Connection string** box.
1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-add-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a connection in IoT Explorer":::

1. If the connection succeeds, IoT Explorer switches to the **Devices** view.

To add the public model repository:

1. In IoT Explorer, select **Home** to return to the home view.
1. On the left menu, select **IoT Plug and Play Settings**, then select **+Add** and select **Public repository** from the drop-down menu.
1. An entry appears for the public model repository at `https://devicemodels.azure.com`.

1. Select **Save**.

### Register a device

In this section, you create a new device instance and register it with the IoT hub you created. You'll use the connection information for the newly registered device to securely connect your physical device in a later section.

To register a device:

1. From the home view in IoT Explorer, select **IoT hubs**.
1. The connection you previously added should appear. Select **View devices in this hub** below the connection properties.
1. Select **+ New** and enter a device ID for your device; for example, *mydevice*. Leave all other properties the same.
1. Select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-device-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure IoT Explorer device identity":::

1. Use the copy buttons to copy and note down the **Device ID** and **Primary key** fields.

Before continuing to the next section, confirm that you've copied the following values:

* `hostName`
* `deviceId`
* `primaryKey`

## Prepare the device

To connect the MXCHIP DevKit to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\app\azure_config.h*

1. Comment out the following line near the top of the file as shown:

    ```c
    // #define ENABLE_DPS
    ```

1. Set the Wi-Fi constants to the following values from your local environment.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi SSID*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_MODE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME` |{*Your Iot hub hostName value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

1. In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

    *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\tools\rebuild.bat*

2. After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

    *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\build\app\mxchip_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the MXCHIP DevKit, locate the **Reset** button, and the Micro USB port. You use these components in the following steps. Both are highlighted in the following picture:

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/mxchip-iot-devkit.png" alt-text="Locate key components on the MXChip devkit board":::

    ```

Keep Termite open to monitor device output in the following steps.

## View device properties

You can use Azure IoT Explorer to view and manage the properties of your devices. In this section and the following sections, you'll use the Plug and Play capabilities that surfaced in IoT Explorer to manage and interact with the MXCHIP DevKit. These capabilities rely on the device model published for the MXCHIP DevKit in the public model repository. You configured IoT Explorer to search this repository for device models earlier in this quickstart. In many cases, you can perform the same action without using plug and play by selecting the same action from the left side menu of your device pane in IoT Explorer. However, using plug and play often provides an enhanced experience. This is because IoT Explorer can read the device model specified by a plug and play device and present information specific to that device.  

To access IoT Plug and Play components for the device in IoT Explorer:

1. From the home view in IoT Explorer, select **IoT hubs**, then select **View devices in this hub**.
1. Select your device.
1. Select **IoT Plug and Play components**.
1. Select **Default component**. IoT Explorer displays the IoT Plug and Play components that are implemented on your device.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-default-component-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of MXCHIP DevKit default component in IoT Explorer":::

1. On the **Interface** tab, view the JSON content in the device model **Description**. The JSON contains configuration details for each of the IoT Plug and Play components in the device model.

    Each tab in IoT Explorer corresponds to one of the IoT Plug and Play components in the device model.

    | Tab | Type | Name | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Interface** | Interface | `MXCHIP Getting Started Guide` | Example model for the MXCHIP DevKit |
    | **Properties (read-only)** | Property | -- | The model currently doesn't have any read-only properties |
    | **Properties (writable)** | Property | `telemetryInterval` | The interval that the device sends telemetry |
    | **Commands** | Command | `setLedState` | Turn the LED on or off |
    | **Telemetry** | Telemetry | `temperature` | The temperature in Celsius |

To view device properties using Azure IoT Explorer:

1. Select the **Properties (read-only)** tab. Currently, there aren't any read-only properties exposed by the device model.
1. Select the **Properties (writable)** tab. It displays the interval that telemetry is sent.
1. Change the `telemetryInterval` to *5*, and then select **Update desired value**. Your device now uses this interval to send telemetry.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-set-telemetry-interval.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting telemetry interval on MXCHIP DevKit in IoT Explorer":::

1. IoT Explorer responds with a notification. You can also observe the update in Termite.
1. Set the telemetry interval back to 10.
 
To use Azure CLI to view device properties:

1. Run the [az iot hub device-identity show](/cli/azure/iot/hub/device-identity#az_iot_hub_device_identity_show) command.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub device-identity show --device-id mydevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. Inspect the properties for your device in the console output.

## View telemetry

With Azure IoT Explorer, you can view the flow of telemetry from your device to the cloud. Optionally, you can do the same task using Azure CLI.

To view telemetry in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. From the **IoT Plug and Play components** (Default Component) pane for your device in IoT Explorer, select the **Telemetry** tab. Confirm that **Use built-in event hub** is set to *Yes*.
1. Select **Start**.
1. View the telemetry as the device sends messages to the cloud.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-device-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of device telemetry in IoT Explorer":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also monitor telemetry from the device by using the Termite app.

1. Select the **Show modeled events** checkbox to view the events in the data format specified by the device model.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-show-modeled-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot of modeled telemetry events in IoT Explorer":::

1. Select **Stop** to end receiving events.

To use Azure CLI to view device telemetry:

1. Run the [az iot hub monitor-events](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az_iot_hub_monitor_events) command. Use the names that you created previously in Azure IoT for your device and IoT hub.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub monitor-events --device-id mydevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. View the JSON output in the console.

    ```json
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydevice",
            "module": "",
            "interface": "dtmi:azurertos:devkit:gsgmxchip;1",
            "component": "",
            "payload": "{\"humidity\":41.21,\"temperature\":31.37,\"pressure\":1005.18}"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select CTRL+C to end monitoring.


## Call a direct method on the device

You can also use Azure IoT Explorer to call a direct method that you've implemented on your device. Direct methods have a name, and can optionally have a JSON payload, configurable connection, and method timeout. In this section, you call a method that turns an LED on or off. Optionally, you can do the same task using Azure CLI.

To call a method in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. From the **IoT Plug and Play components** (Default Component) pane for your device in IoT Explorer, select the **Commands** tab.
1. For the **setLedState** command, set the **state** to **true**.
1. Select **Send command**. You should see a notification in IoT Explorer, and the yellow User LED light on the device should turn on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-invoke-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot of calling the setLedState method in IoT Explorer":::

1. Set the **state** to  **false**, and then select **Send command**. The yellow User LED should turn off.
1. Optionally, you can view the output in Termite to monitor the status of the methods.

To use Azure CLI to call a method:

1. Run the [az iot hub invoke-device-method](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az_iot_hub_invoke_device_method) command, and specify the method name and payload. For this method, setting `method-payload` to `true` turns on the LED, and setting it to `false` turns it off.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub invoke-device-method --device-id mydevice --method-name setLedState --method-payload true --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

    The CLI console shows the status of your method call on the device, where `204` indicates success.

    ```json
    {
        "payload": {},
        "status": 200
    }    
    ```

1. Check your device to confirm the LED state.

1. View the Termite terminal to confirm the output messages:

    ```output
    Receive direct method: setLedState
	    Payload: true
    LED is turned ON
    Device twin property sent: {"ledState":true}
    ```

## Troubleshoot and debug

If you experience issues building the device code, flashing the device, or connecting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-embedded-device-quickstarts.md).

For debugging the application, see [Debugging with Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/debugging.md).

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the Azure resources created in this quickstart, you can use the Azure CLI to delete the resource group and all of its resources.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources.

To delete a resource group by name:

1. Run the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. This removes the resource group, the IoT Hub, and the device registration you created.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group delete --name MyResourceGroup
    ```

1. Run the [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list) command to confirm the resource group is deleted.  

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group list
    ```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you built a custom image that contains Azure RTOS sample code, and then flashed the image to the MXCHIP DevKit device. You also used the Azure CLI and/or IoT Explorer to create Azure resources, connect the MXCHIP DevKit securely to Azure, view telemetry, and send messages.

As a next step, explore the following articles to learn more about using the IoT device SDKs to connect devices to Azure IoT.
