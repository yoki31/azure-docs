### Build and flash the image
In this section, you use the ESP-IDF tools to build, flash, and monitor the ESP32 DevKit as it connects to Azure IoT.  

> [!NOTE]
> In the following commands in this section, use a short build output path near your root directory. Specify the build path after the `-B` parameter in each command that requires it. The short path helps to avoid a current issue in the ESPRESSIF ESP-IDF tools that can cause errors with long build path names.  The following commands use a local path *C:\espbuild* as an example.

To build the image:
1. In **ESP-IDF PowerShell**, from the *iot-middleware-freertos-samples\demos\projects\ESPRESSIF\aziotkit* directory, run the following command to build the image.

    ```shell
    idf.py --no-ccache -B "C:\espbuild" build 
    ```

1. After the build completes, confirm that the binary image file was created in the build path that you specified previously.

    *C:\espbuild\azure_iot_freertos_esp32.bin*

To flash the image:
1. On the ESP32 DevKit, locate the Micro USB port, which is highlighted in the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-espressif-esp32/esp-azure-iot-kit.png" alt-text="Photo of the ESP32-Azure IoT Kit board.":::

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the Micro USB port on the ESP32 DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.
1. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to find out which COM port the ESP32 DevKit is connected to.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-espressif-esp32/esp-device-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Windows Device Manager displaying COM port for a connected device.":::

1. In **ESP-IDF PowerShell**, run the following command, replacing the *\<Your-COM-port\>* placeholder and brackets with the correct COM port from the previous step. For example, replace the placeholder with `COM3`. 

    ```shell
    idf.py --no-ccache -B "C:\espbuild" -p <Your-COM-port> flash
    ```

1. Confirm that the output completes with the following text for a successful flash:

    ```output
    Hash of data verified
    
    Leaving...
    Hard resetting via RTS pin...
    Done
    ```

To confirm that the device connects to Azure IoT Central:
1. In **ESP-IDF PowerShell**, run the following command to start the monitoring tool. As you did in a previous command, replace the *\<Your-COM-port\>* placeholder and brackets with the COM port that the device is connected to.

    ```shell
    idf.py -B "C:\espbuild" -p <Your-COM-port> monitor
    ```

1. Check for repeating blocks of output similar to the following example. This output confirms that the device connects to Azure IoT and sends telemetry.

    ```output
    I (50807) AZ IOT: Successfully sent telemetry message
    I (50807) AZ IOT: Attempt to receive publish message from IoT Hub.
    
    I (51057) MQTT: Packet received. ReceivedBytes=2.
    I (51057) MQTT: Ack packet deserialized with result: MQTTSuccess.
    I (51057) MQTT: State record updated. New state=MQTTPublishDone.
    I (51067) AZ IOT: Puback received for packet id: 0x00000008
    I (53067) AZ IOT: Keeping Connection Idle...
    ```
