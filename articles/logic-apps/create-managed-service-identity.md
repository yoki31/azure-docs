# Authenticate access to Azure resources with managed identities in Azure Logic Apps

In logic app workflows, some triggers and actions support using a [managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) to authenticate access to resources protected by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This identity was previously known as a *Managed Service Identity (MSI)*. When you enable your logic app resource to use a managed identity for authentication, you don't have to provide credentials, secrets, or Azure AD tokens. Azure manages this identity and helps keep authentication information secure because you don't have to manage this sensitive information.

Azure Logic Apps supports the [*system-assigned* managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) and the [*user-assigned* managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md), but the following differences exist between these identity types:

* A logic app resource can enable and use only one unique system-assigned identity.

* A logic app resource can share the same user-assigned identity across a group of other logic app resources.

* Based on your logic app resource type, you can enable either the system-assigned identity, user-assigned identity, or both at the same time:

  | Logic app resource type | Environment | Managed identity support |
  |-------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
  | Consumption | - Multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps <p><p>- Integration service environment (ISE) | - You can enable *either* the system-assigned identity type *or* the user-assigned identity type on your logic app resource. <p>- If enabled with the user-assigned identity type, your logic app resource can have *only a single user-assigned identity* at any one time. <p>- You can use the identity at the logic app resource level and at the connection level. |
  | Standard | - Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps <p><p>- App Service Environment v3 (ASEv3) <p><p>- Azure Arc enabled Logic Apps | - You can enable *both* the system-assigned identity type, which is enabled by default, *and* the user-assigned identity type at the same time. <p>- Your logic app resource can have *multiple* user-assigned identities at the same time. <p>- You can use the identity at the logic app resource level and at the connection level. |

To learn more about managed identity limits in Azure Logic Apps, review [Limits on managed identities for logic apps](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#managed-identity). For more information about the Consumption and Standard logic app resource types and environments, review the following documentation:

* [What is Azure Logic Apps?](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences)
* [Single-tenant versus multi-tenant and integration service environment](single-tenant-overview-compare.md)
* [Azure Arc enabled Logic Apps](azure-arc-enabled-logic-apps-overview.md)

## Where you can use a managed identity

Only specific built-in and managed connector operations that support Azure AD Open Authentication (Azure AD OAuth) can use a managed identity for authentication. The following table provides only a *sample selection*. For a more complete list, review [Authentication types for triggers and actions that support authentication](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#authentication-types-supported-triggers-actions) and [Azure services that support Azure AD authentication with managed identities](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-azure-ad-authentication).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

The following table lists the operations where you can use either the system-assigned managed identity or user-assigned managed identity in the **Logic App (Consumption)** resource type:

| Operation type | Supported operations |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Built-in | - Azure API Management <br>- Azure App Services <br>- Azure Functions <br>- HTTP <br>- HTTP + Webhook <p>**Note**: HTTP operations can authenticate connections to Azure Storage accounts behind Azure firewalls with the system-assigned identity. However, they don't support the user-assigned managed identity for authenticating the same connections. |
| Managed connector (**Preview**) | Single-authentication: <br>- Azure Automation <br>- Azure Event Grid <br>- Azure Key Vault <br>- Azure Resource Manager <br>- HTTP with Azure AD <p>Multi-authentication: <br>- Azure Blob Storage <br>- SQL Server |
|||

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

The following table lists the operations where you can use both the system-assigned managed identity and multiple user-assigned managed identities in the **Logic App (Standard)** resource type:

| Operation type | Supported operations |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Built-in | - HTTP <br>- HTTP + Webhook <p>**Note**: HTTP operations can authenticate connections to Azure Storage accounts behind Azure firewalls with the system-assigned identity. |
| Managed connector (**Preview**) | Single-authentication: <br>- Azure Automation <br>- Azure Event Grid <br>- Azure Key Vault <br>- Azure Resource Manager <br>- HTTP with Azure AD <p>Multi-authentication: <br>- Azure Blob Storage <br>- SQL Server |

This article shows how to enable and set up the system-assigned identity or user-assigned identity, based on whether you're using the **Logic App (Consumption)** or **Logic App (Standard)** resource type. Unlike the system-assigned identity, which you don't have to manually create, you *do* have to manually create the user-assigned identity. This article includes the steps to create the user-assigned identity using the Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template). For Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure REST API, review the following documentation:

| Tool | Documentation |
|------|---------------|
| Azure PowerShell | [Create user-assigned identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-powershell.md) |
| Azure CLI | [Create user-assigned identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-cli.md) |
| Azure REST API | [Create user-assigned identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-rest.md) |
|||

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Both the managed identity and the target Azure resource where you need access must use the same Azure subscription.

* To give a managed identity access to an Azure resource, you need to add a role to the target resource for that identity. To add roles, you need [Azure AD administrator permissions](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md) that can assign roles to identities in the corresponding Azure AD tenant.

* The target Azure resource that you want to access. On this resource, you'll add a role for the managed identity, which helps the logic app resource or connection authenticate access to the target resource.

* The logic app resource where you want to use the [trigger or actions that support managed identities](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#authentication-types-supported-triggers-actions).

## Enable system-assigned identity in Azure portal

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Identity**.

1. On the **Identity** pane, under **System assigned**, select **On** > **Save**. When Azure prompts you to confirm, select **Yes**.

   ![Screenshot showing Azure portal with Consumption logic app's "Identity" pane and "System assigned" tab with "On" and "Save" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/enable-system-assigned-identity-consumption.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you get an error that you can have only a single managed identity, your logic app resource is already associated with the 
   > user-assigned identity. Before you can add the system-assigned identity, you have to first *remove* the user-assigned identity 
   > from your logic app resource.

   Your logic app resource can now use the system-assigned identity. This identity is registered with Azure AD and is represented by an object ID.

   ![Screenshot showing Consumption logic app's "Identity" pane with the object ID for system-assigned identity.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/object-id-system-assigned-identity.png)

   | Property | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Object (principal) ID** | <*identity-resource-ID*> | A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the system-assigned identity for your logic app in an Azure AD tenant. |
   ||||

1. Now follow the [steps that give that identity access to the resource](#access-other-resources) later in this topic.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

On a **Logic App (Standard)** resource, the system-assigned identity is automatically enabled.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app workflow in the designer.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Identity**.

1. On the **Identity** pane, under **System assigned**, select **On** > **Save**. When Azure prompts you to confirm, select **Yes**.

   ![Screenshot showing Azure portal with Standard logic app's "Identity" pane and "System assigned" tab with "On" and "Save" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/enable-system-assigned-identity-standard.png)

   Your logic app resource can now use the system-assigned identity, which is registered with Azure AD and is represented by an object ID.

   ![Screenshot showing Standard logic app's "Identity" pane with the object ID for system-assigned identity.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/object-id-system-assigned-identity.png)

   | Property | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Object (principal) ID** | <*identity-resource-ID*> | A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the system-assigned identity for your logic app in an Azure AD tenant. |
   ||||

1. Now follow the [steps that give that identity access to the resource](#access-other-resources) later in this topic.

## Enable system-assigned identity in an ARM template

To automate creating and deploying Azure resources such as logic apps, you can use an [ARM template](logic-apps-azure-resource-manager-templates-overview.md). To enable the system-assigned managed identity for your logic app resource in the template, add the `identity` object and the `type` child property to the logic app's resource definition in the template, for example:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

```json
{
   "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
   "type": "Microsoft.logic/workflows",
   "name": "[variables('logicappName')]",
   "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
   "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned"
   },
   "properties": {},
   <...>
}
```

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

```json
{
   "apiVersion": "2021-01-15",
   "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
   "name": "[variables('sites_<logic-app-resource-name>_name')]",
   "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
   "kind": "functionapp,workflowapp",
   "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned"
   },
   "properties": {},
   <...>
}
```

---

When Azure creates your logic app resource definition, the `identity` object gets these other properties:

```json
"identity": {
   "type": "SystemAssigned",
   "principalId": "<principal-ID>",
   "tenantId": "<Azure-AD-tenant-ID>"
}
```

| Property (JSON) | Value | Description |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| `principalId` | <*principal-ID*> | The Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) of the service principal object for the managed identity that represents your logic app in the Azure AD tenant. This GUID sometimes appears as an "object ID" or `objectID`. |
| `tenantId` | <*Azure-AD-tenant-ID*> | The Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the Azure AD tenant where the logic app is now a member. Inside the Azure AD tenant, the service principal has the same name as the logic app instance. |

<a name="user-assigned-azure-portal"></a>

## Create user-assigned identity in the Azure portal

Before you can enable the user-assigned identity on your **Logic App (Consumption)** or **Logic App (Standard)** resource, you have to first create that identity as a separate Azure resource.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter `managed identities`. Select **Managed Identities**.

   ![Screenshot showing Azure portal with "Managed Identities" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/find-select-managed-identities.png)

1. On the **Managed Identities** pane, select **Create**.

   ![Screenshot showing "Managed Identities" pane and "Create" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/add-user-assigned-identity.png)

1. Provide information about your managed identity, and then select **Review + Create**, for example:

   ![Screenshot showing "Create User Assigned Managed Identity" pane with managed identity details.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/create-user-assigned-identity.png)

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | The name for the Azure subscription to use |
   | **Resource group** | Yes | <*Azure-resource-group-name*> | The name for the Azure resource group to use. Create a new group, or select an existing group. This example creates a new group named `fabrikam-managed-identities-RG`. |
   | **Region** | Yes | <*Azure-region*> | The Azure region where to store information about your resource. This example uses **West US**. |
   | **Name** | Yes | <*user-assigned-identity-name*> | The name to give your user-assigned identity. This example uses `Fabrikam-user-assigned-identity`. |
   |||||

   After Azure validates the information, Azure creates your managed identity. Now you can add the user-assigned identity to your logic app resource.

## Add user-assigned identity to logic app in the Azure portal

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the Azure portal, open your logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Identity**.

1. On the **Identity** pane, select **User assigned** > **Add**.

   ![Screenshot showing Consumption logic app and "Identity" pane with "Add" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/add-user-assigned-identity-logic-app-consumption.png)

1. On the **Add user assigned managed identity** pane, follow these steps:

   1. From the **Subscription** list, select your Azure subscription, if not already selected.

   1. From the list with *all* the managed identities in that subscription, select the user-assigned identity that you want. To filter the list, in the **User assigned managed identities** search box, enter the name for the identity or resource group.

      ![Screenshot showing Consumption logic app and the user-assigned identity selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-user-assigned-identity-consumption.png)

   1. When you're done, select **Add**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you get an error that you can have only a single managed identity, your logic app 
      > is already associated with the system-assigned identity. Before you can add the 
      > user-assigned identity, you have to first disable the system-assigned identity.

   Your logic app is now associated with the user-assigned managed identity.

   ![Screenshot showing Consumption logic app and association between user-assigned identity and logic app resource.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/added-user-assigned-identity-consumption.png)

1. Now follow the [steps that give that identity access to the resource](#access-other-resources) later in this topic.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the Azure portal, open your logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Identity**.

1. On the **Identity** pane, select **User assigned** > **Add**.

   ![Screenshot showing Standard logic app and "Identity" pane with "Add" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/add-user-assigned-identity-logic-app-standard.png)

1. On the **Add user assigned managed identity** pane, follow these steps:

   1. From the **Subscription** list, select your Azure subscription, if not already selected.

   1. From the list with *all* the managed identities in that subscription, select the user-assigned identity that you want. To filter the list, in the **User assigned managed identities** search box, enter the name for the identity or resource group.

      ![Screenshot showing Standard logic app and the user-assigned identity selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-user-assigned-identity-standard.png)

   1. When you're done, select **Add**.

      Your logic app is now associated with the user-assigned managed identity.

      ![Screenshot showing Standard logic app and association between user-assigned identity and logic app resource.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/added-user-assigned-identity-standard.png)

   1. To use multiple user-assigned managed identities, repeat the same steps to add the identity.

1. Now follow the [steps that give the identity access to the resource](#access-other-resources) later in this topic.

## Create user-assigned identity in an ARM template

To automate creating and deploying Azure resources such as logic apps, you can use an [ARM template](logic-apps-azure-resource-manager-templates-overview.md), which support [user-assigned identities for authentication](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-arm.md).

In your template's `resources` section, your logic app's resource definition requires these items:

* An `identity` object with the `type` property set to `UserAssigned`

* A child `userAssignedIdentities` object that specifies the user-assigned resource and name

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

This example shows a Consumption logic app resource definition for an HTTP PUT request and includes a non-parameterized `identity` object. The response to the PUT request and subsequent GET operation also have this `identity` object:

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
   "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
   "parameters": {<template-parameters>},
   "resources": [
      {
         "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
         "type": "Microsoft.logic/workflows",
         "name": "[variables('logicappName')]",
         "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
         "identity": {
            "type": "UserAssigned",
            "userAssignedIdentities": {
               "/subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<user-assigned-identity-name>": {}
            }
         },
         "properties": {
            "definition": {<logic-app-workflow-definition>}
         },
         "parameters": {},
         "dependsOn": []
      },
   ],
   "outputs": {}
}
```

If your template also includes the managed identity's resource definition, you can parameterize the `identity` object. This example shows how the child `userAssignedIdentities` object references a `userAssignedIdentityName` variable that you define in your template's `variables` section. This variable references the resource ID for your user-assigned identity.

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
   "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
   "parameters": {
      "Template_LogicAppName": {
         "type": "string"
      },
      "Template_UserAssignedIdentityName": {
         "type": "securestring"
      }
   },
   "variables": {
      "logicAppName": "[parameters(`Template_LogicAppName')]",
      "userAssignedIdentityName": "[parameters('Template_UserAssignedIdentityName')]"
   },
   "resources": [
      {
         "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
         "type": "Microsoft.logic/workflows",
         "name": "[variables('logicAppName')]",
         "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
         "identity": {
            "type": "UserAssigned",
            "userAssignedIdentities": {
               "[resourceId('Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/', variables('userAssignedIdentityName'))]": {}
            }
         },
         "properties": {
            "definition": {<logic-app-workflow-definition>}
         },
         "parameters": {},
         "dependsOn": [
            "[resourceId('Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/', variables('userAssignedIdentityName'))]"
         ]
      },
      {
         "apiVersion": "2018-11-30",
         "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities",
         "name": "[parameters('Template_UserAssignedIdentityName')]",
         "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
         "properties": {}
      }
  ]
}
```

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

A Standard logic app resource can enable and use both the system-assigned identity and multiple user-assigned identities. The Standard logic app resource definition is based on the Azure Functions function app resource definition.

This example shows a Standard logic app resource definition that includes a non-parameterized `identity` object:

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
   "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
   "parameters": {<template-parameters>},
   "resources": [
      {
         "apiVersion": "2021-02-01",
         "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites/functions",
         "name": "[variables('logicappName')]",
         "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
         "identity": {
            "type": "UserAssigned",
            "userAssignedIdentities": {
               "/subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<user-assigned-identity-name>": {}
            },
         },
         "properties": {
            "name": "[variables('appName')]",
            "serverFarmId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('hostingPlanName'))]",
            "hostingEnvironment": "",
            "clientAffinityEnabled": false,
            "alwaysOn": true
         },
         "parameters": {},
         "dependsOn": []
      }
   ],
   "outputs": {}
}
```

If your template also includes the managed identity's resource definition, you can parameterize the `identity` object. This example shows how the child `userAssignedIdentities` object references a `userAssignedIdentityName` variable that you define in your template's `variables` section. This variable references the resource ID for your user-assigned identity.

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
   "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
   "parameters": {<template-parameters>},
   "resources": [
      {
         "apiVersion": "2021-02-01",
         "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites/functions",
         "name": "[variables('logicappName')]",
         "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
         "identity": {
            "type": "UserAssigned",
            "userAssignedIdentities": {
               "[resourceId(Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities', variables('userAssignedIdentityName'))]": {}
            }
         },
         "properties": {
            "name": "[variables('appName')]",
            "serverFarmId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('hostingPlanName'))]",
            "hostingEnvironment": "",
            "clientAffinityEnabled": false,
            "alwaysOn": true
         },
         "parameters": {},
         "dependsOn": [
            "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('hostingPlanName'))]",
            "[resourceId('Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/', variables('userAssignedIdentityName'))]"
         ]
      },
      {
         "apiVersion": "2018-11-30",
         "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities",
         "name": "[parameters('Template_UserAssignedIdentityName')]",
         "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
         "properties": {}
      },
   ],
   "outputs": {}
}
```

When the logic app resource is created, the `identity` object has the following additional properties:

```json
"identity": {
    "type": "UserAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "<resource-ID>": {
            "principalId": "<principal-ID>",
            "clientId": "<client-ID>"
        }
    }
}
```

The `principalId` property value is a unique identifier for the identity that's used for Azure AD administration. The `clientId` property value is a unique identifier for the logic app's new identity that's used for specifying which identity to use during runtime calls. For more information about Azure Resource Manager templates and managed identities for Azure Functions, review [ARM template - Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-resource-manager.md#review-the-template) and [Add a user-assigned identity using an ARM template for Azure Functions](../app-service/overview-managed-identity.md?tabs=arm%2Chttp#add-a-user-assigned-identity).

## Give identity access to resources

Before you can use your logic app's managed identity for authentication, you have to set up access for the identity on the Azure resource where you want to use the identity. The way you set up access varies based on the resource that you want the identity to access.

> [!NOTE]
> When a managed identity has access to an Azure resource in the same subscription, the identity can 
> access only that resource. However, in some triggers and actions that support managed identities, 
> you have to first select the Azure resource group that contains the target resource. If the identity 
> doesn't have access at the resource group level, no resources in that group are listed, despite having 
> access to the target resource.
>
> To handle this behavior, you must also give the identity access to the resource group, not just 
> the resource. Likewise, if you have to select your subscription before you can select the 
> target resource, you must give the identity access to the subscription.

For example, to access an Azure Blob storage account with your managed identity, you have to set up access by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and assign the appropriate role for that identity to the storage account. The steps in this section describe how to complete this task by using the [Azure portal](#azure-portal-assign-role) and [Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-template.md). For Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure REST API, review the following documentation:

However, to access an Azure key vault with your managed identity, you have to create an access policy for that identity on your key vault and assign the appropriate permissions for that identity on that key vault. The later steps in this section describe how to complete this task by using the [Azure portal](#azure-portal-access-policy). For Resource Manager templates, PowerShell, and Azure CLI, review the following documentation:

### Assign managed identity role-based access in the Azure portal

To use a managed identity for authentication, some Azure resources, such as Azure storage accounts, require that you assign that identity to a role that has the appropriate permissions on the target resource. Other Azure resources, such as Azure key vaults, require that you [create an access policy that has the appropriate permissions on the target resource for that identity](#azure-portal-access-policy).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the resource where you want to use the identity.

1. On the resource's menu, select **Access control (IAM)** > **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **Add role assignment** option is disabled, you don't have permissions to assign roles. 
   > For more information, review [Azure AD built-in roles](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md).

1. Now, assign the necessary role to your managed identity. On the **Role** tab, assign a role that gives your identity the required access to the current resource.

   For this example, assign the role that's named **Storage Blob Data Contributor**, which includes write access for blobs in an Azure Storage container. For more information about specific storage container roles, review [Roles that can access blobs in an Azure Storage container](../storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory.md#assign-azure-roles-for-access-rights).

1. Next, choose the managed identity where you want to assign the role. Under **Assign access to**, select **Managed identity** > **Add members**.

1. Based on your managed identity's type, select or provide the following values:

   | Type | Azure service instance | Subscription | Member |
   |------|------------------------|--------------|--------|
   | **System-assigned** | **Logic App** | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | <*your-logic-app-name*> |
   | **User-assigned** | Not applicable | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | <*your-user-assigned-identity-name*> |
   |||||

   For more information about assigning roles, review the documentation, [Assign roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

1. After you finish, you can use the identity to [authenticate access for triggers and actions that support managed identities](#authenticate-access-with-identity).

For more general information about this task, review [Assign a managed identity access to another resource using Azure RBAC](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/howto-assign-access-portal.md).

<a name="azure-portal-access-policy"></a>

### Create access policy in the Azure portal

To use a managed identity for authentication, some Azure resources, such as Azure key vaults, require that you create an access policy that has the appropriate permissions on the target resource for that identity. Other Azure resources, such as Azure storage accounts, require that you [assign that identity to a role that has the appropriate permissions on the target resource](#azure-portal-assign-role).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the target resource where you want to use the identity. This example uses an Azure key vault as the target resource.

1. On the resource's menu, select **Access policies** > **Create**, which opens the **Create an access policy** pane.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the resource doesn't have the **Access policies** option, [try assigning a role assignment instead](#azure-portal-assign-role).

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure portal and key vault example with "Access policies" pane open.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/create-access-policy.png)

1. On the **Permissions** tab, select the required permissions that the identity needs to access the target resource.

   For example, to use the identity with the managed Azure Key Vault connector's **List secrets** operation, the identity needs **List** permissions. So, in the **Secret permissions** column, select **List**.

   ![Screenshot showing "Permissions" tab with "List" permissions selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-access-policy-permissions.png)

1. When you're ready, select **Next**. On the **Principal** tab, find and select the managed identity, which is a user-assigned identity in this example.

1. Skip the optional **Application** step, select **Next**, and finish creating the access policy.

In the next section about using a managed identity to authenticate access for a trigger or action, the example continues with the steps from an earlier section where you set up access for a managed identity using RBAC and doesn't use Azure Key Vault as the example. However, the general steps to use a managed identity for authentication are the same.

<a name="authenticate-access-with-identity"></a>

## Authenticate access with managed identity

After you [enable the managed identity for your logic app resource](#azure-portal-system-logic-app) and [give that identity access to the target resource or entity](#access-other-resources), you can use that identity in [triggers and actions that support managed identities](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#authentication-types-supported-triggers-actions).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have an Azure function where you want to use the system-assigned identity, 
> first [enable authentication for Azure Functions](logic-apps-azure-functions.md#enable-authentication-for-functions).

These steps show how to use the managed identity with a trigger or action through the Azure portal. To specify the managed identity in a trigger or action's underlying JSON definition, review [Managed identity authentication](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#managed-identity-authentication).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource.

1. If you haven't done so yet, add the [trigger or action that supports managed identities](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#authentication-types-supported-triggers-actions).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Not all triggers and actions support letting you add an authentication type. For more information, review 
   > [Authentication types for triggers and actions that support authentication](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#authentication-types-supported-triggers-actions).

1. On the trigger or action that you added, follow these steps:

   * **Built-in operations that support managed identity authentication**

     1. From the **Add new parameter** list, add the **Authentication** property if the property doesn't already appear.

        ![Screenshot showing example built-in action with "Add new parameter" list open and "Authentication" selected in Consumption.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/built-in-authentication-consumption.png)

## Example: Authenticate built-in trigger or action with a managed identity

The built-in HTTP trigger or action can use the system-assigned identity that you enable on your logic app resource. In general, the HTTP trigger or action uses the following properties to specify the resource or entity that you want to access:

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Method** | Yes | The HTTP method that's used by the operation that you want to run |
| **URI** | Yes | The endpoint URL for accessing the target Azure resource or entity. The URI syntax usually includes the [resource ID](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-azure-ad-authentication) for the Azure resource or service. |
| **Headers** | No | Any header values that you need or want to include in the outgoing request, such as the content type |
| **Queries** | No | Any query parameters that you need or want to include in the request, such as the parameter for a specific operation or the API version for the operation that you want to run |
| **Authentication** | Yes | The authentication type to use for authenticating access to the target resource or entity |
||||

As a specific example, suppose that you want to run the [Snapshot Blob operation](/rest/api/storageservices/snapshot-blob) on a blob in the Azure Storage account where you previously set up access for your identity. However, the [Azure Blob Storage connector](/connectors/azureblob/) doesn't currently offer this operation. Instead, you can run this operation by using the [HTTP action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#http-action) or another [Blob Service REST API operation](/rest/api/storageservices/operations-on-blobs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access Azure storage accounts behind firewalls by using HTTP requests and managed identities, 
> make sure that you also set up your storage account with the [exception that allows access by trusted Microsoft services](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-blob-storage-with-managed-identities).

To run the [Snapshot Blob operation](/rest/api/storageservices/snapshot-blob), the HTTP action specifies these properties:

| Property | Required | Example value | Description |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Method** | Yes | `PUT`| The HTTP method that the Snapshot Blob operation uses |
| **URI** | Yes | `https://<storage-account-name>/<folder-name>/{name}` | The resource ID for an Azure Blob Storage file in the Azure Global (public) environment, which uses this syntax |
| **Headers** | For Azure Storage | `x-ms-blob-type` = `BlockBlob` <p>`x-ms-version` = `2019-02-02` <p>`x-ms-date` = `@{formatDateTime(utcNow(),'r')}` | The `x-ms-blob-type`, `x-ms-version`, and `x-ms-date` header values are required for Azure Storage operations. <p><p>**Important**: In outgoing HTTP trigger and action requests for Azure Storage, the header requires the `x-ms-version` property and the API version for the operation that you want to run. The `x-ms-date` must be the current date. Otherwise, your workflow fails with a `403 FORBIDDEN` error. To get the current date in the required format, you can use the expression in the example value. <p>For more information, review these topics: <p><p>- [Request headers - Snapshot Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/snapshot-blob#request) <br>- [Versioning for Azure Storage services](/rest/api/storageservices/versioning-for-the-azure-storage-services#specifying-service-versions-in-requests) |
| **Queries** | Only for the Snapshot Blob operation | `comp` = `snapshot` | The query parameter name and value for the operation. |
|||||

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

The following example shows a sample HTTP action with all the previously described property values to use for the Snapshot Blob operation:

![Screenshot showing Azure portal with Consumption logic app workflow and HTTP action set up to access resource.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/http-action-example.png)

1. After you add the HTTP action, add the **Authentication** property to the HTTP action. From the **Add new parameter** list, select **Authentication**.

   ![Screenshot showing Consumption workflow with HTTP action and "Add new parameter" list open with "Authentication" property selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/add-authentication-property.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Not all triggers and actions support letting you add an authentication type. For more information, review 
   > [Authentication types for triggers and actions that support authentication](logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md#authentication-types-supported-triggers-actions).

1. From the **Authentication type** list, select **Managed identity**.

   ![Screenshot showing Consumption workflow with HTTP action and "Authentication" property with "Managed identity" value selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-managed-identity.png)

1. From the managed identity list, select from the available options based on your scenario.

   * If you set up the system-assigned identity, select **System-assigned managed identity** if not already selected.

     ![Screenshot showing Consumption workflow with HTTP action and "Managed identity" property with "System-assigned managed identity" value elected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-system-assigned-identity.png)

   * If you set up a user-assigned identity, select that identity if not already selected.

     ![Screenshot showing Consumption workflow with HTTP action and "Managed identity" property with user-assigned identity selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-user-assigned-identity-action.png)

   This example continues with the **System-assigned managed identity**.

1. On some triggers and actions, the **Audience** property also appears for you to set the target resource ID. Set the **Audience** property to the [resource ID for the target resource or service](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-azure-ad-authentication). Otherwise, by default, the **Audience** property uses the `https://management.azure.com/` resource ID, which is the resource ID for Azure Resource Manager.
  
    For example, if you want to authenticate access to a [Key Vault resource in the global Azure cloud](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-key-vault), you must set the **Audience** property to *exactly* the following resource ID: `https://vault.azure.net`. Note that this specific resource ID *doesn't* have any trailing slashes. In fact, including a trailing slash might produce either a `400 Bad Request` error or a `401 Unauthorized` error.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure that the target resource ID *exactly matches* the value that Azure Active Directory (AD) expects, 
   > including any required trailing slashes. For example, the resource ID for all Azure Blob Storage accounts requires 
   > a trailing slash. However, the resource ID for a specific storage account doesn't require a trailing slash. Check the 
   > [resource IDs for the Azure services that support Azure AD](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-azure-ad-authentication).

   This example sets the **Audience** property to `https://storage.azure.com/` so that the access tokens used for authentication are valid for all storage accounts. However, you can also specify the root service URL, `https://<your-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net`, for a specific storage account.

   ![Screenshot showing Consumption workflow with HTTP action and "Audience" property set to target resource ID.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/specify-audience-url-target-resource.png)

1. Continue building the workflow the way that you want.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

![Screenshot showing Azure portal with Standard logic app workflow and HTTP action set up to access resource.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/http-action-example-standard.png)

1. After you add the HTTP action, add the **Authentication** property to the HTTP action. From the **Add new parameter** list, select **Authentication**.

   ![Screenshot showing Standard workflow with HTTP action and "Add new parameter" list open with "Authentication" property selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/add-authentication-property-standard.png)

1. From the **Authentication type** list, select **Managed identity**.

   ![Screenshot showing Standard workflow with HTTP action and "Authentication" property with "Managed identity" value selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-managed-identity-standard.png)

1. From the managed identity list, select **System-assigned managed identity** if not already selected.

1. On some triggers and actions, the **Audience** property also appears for you to set the target resource ID. Set the **Audience** property to the [resource ID for the target resource or service](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-services-that-support-azure-ad-authentication). Otherwise, by default, the **Audience** property uses the `https://management.azure.com/` resource ID, which is the resource ID for Azure Resource Manager.
  
    For example, if you want to authenticate access to a [Key Vault resource in the global Azure cloud](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md#azure-key-vault), you must set the **Audience** property to *exactly* the following resource ID: `https://vault.azure.net`.

<a name="authenticate-managed-connector-managed-identity"></a>

## Example: Authenticate managed connector trigger or action with a managed identity

The Azure Resource Manager managed connector has an action, **Read a resource**, that can use the managed identity that you enable on your logic app resource. This example shows how to use the system-assigned managed identity.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. After you add the action to your workflow and select your Azure AD tenant, select **Connect with managed identity (preview)**.

   ![Screenshot showing Azure Resource Manager action and "Connect with managed identity" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-connect-managed-identity-consumption.png)

1. On the connection name page, provide a name for the connection, and select the managed identity that you want to use.

   The Azure Resource Manager action is a single-authentication action, so the connection information pane shows a **Managed identity** list that automatically selects the managed identity that's currently enabled on the logic app resource. If you enabled a system-assigned managed identity, the **Managed identity** list selects **System-assigned managed identity**. If you had enabled a user-assigned managed identity instead, the list selects that identity instead.

   If you're using a multi-authentication trigger or action, such as Azure Blob Storage, the connection information pane shows an **Authentication type** list that includes the **Logic Apps Managed Identity** option among other authentication types.

   In this example, **System-assigned managed identity** is the only selection available.

   ![Screenshot showing Azure Resource Manager action with the connection name entered and "System-assigned managed identity" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/single-system-identity-consumption.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the managed identity isn't enabled when you try to create the connection, change the connection, 
   > or was removed while a managed identity-enabled connection still exists, you get an error appears 
   > that you must enable the identity and grant access to the target resource.

1. When you're ready, select **Create**.

1. After the designer successfully creates the connection, the designer can fetch any dynamic values, content, or schema by using managed identity authentication.

1. Continue building the workflow the way that you want.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. After you add the action to your workflow, on the action's **Create Connection** pane, select your Azure AD tenant, and then select **Connect with managed identity (preview)**.

   ![Screenshot showing Azure Resource Manager action and "Connect with managed identity" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-connect-managed-identity-standard.png)

1. On the connection name page, provide a name for the connection.

   The Azure Resource Manager action is a single-authentication action, so the connection information pane shows a **Managed identity** list that automatically selects the managed identity that's currently enabled on the logic app resource. By default, Standard logic apps automatically have the system-assigned managed identity enabled. The **Managed identity** list shows all the currently enabled identities, for example:

   ![Screenshot showing Azure Resource Manager action with the connection name entered and "System-assigned managed identity" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/single-identity-standard.png)

   If you're using a multiple-authentication trigger or action, such as Azure Blob Storage, the connection information pane shows an **Authentication type** list that includes the **Logic Apps Managed Identity** option among other authentication types. After you select this option, on the next pane, you can select an identity from the **Managed identity** list.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the managed identity isn't enabled when you try to create the connection, change the connection, 
   > or was removed while a managed identity-enabled connection still exists, you get an error appears 
   > that you must enable the identity and grant access to the target resource.

1. When you're ready, select **Create**.

1. After the designer successfully creates the connection, the designer can fetch any dynamic values, content, or schema by using managed identity authentication.

1. Continue building the workflow the way that you want.

## Logic app resource definition and connections that use a managed identity

A connection that enables and uses a managed identity are a special connection type that works only with a managed identity. At runtime, the connection uses the managed identity that's enabled on the logic app resource. At runtime, the Azure Logic Apps service checks whether any managed connector trigger and actions in the logic app workflow are set up to use the managed identity and that all the required permissions are set up to use the managed identity for accessing the target resources that are specified by the trigger and actions. If successful, Azure Logic Apps retrieves the Azure AD token that's associated with the managed identity and uses that identity to authenticate access to the target resource and perform the configured operation in trigger and actions.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

In a **Logic App (Consumption)** resource, the connection configuration is saved in the logic app resource definition's `parameters` object, which contains the `$connections` object that includes pointers to the connection's resource ID along with the identity's resource ID, if the user-assigned identity is enabled.

This example shows what the configuration looks like when the logic app enables the *system-assigned* managed identity:

```json
"parameters": {
   "$connections": {
      "value": {
         "<action-name>": {
            "connectionId": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/{connection-name}",
            "connectionName": "{connection-name}",
            "connectionProperties": {
               "authentication": {
                  "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
               }
            },
            "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{Azure-region}/managedApis/{managed-connector-type}"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This example shows what the configuration looks like when the logic app enables a *user-assigned* managed identity:

```json
"parameters": {
   "$connections": {
      "value": {
         "<action-name>": {
            "connectionId": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/{connection-name}",
            "connectionName": "{connection-name}",
            "connectionProperties": {
               "authentication": {
                  "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity",
                  "identity": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/microsoft.managedidentity/userassignedidentities/{managed-identity-name}"
               }
            },
            "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{Azure-region}/managedApis/{managed-connector-type}"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

In a **Logic App (Standard)** resource, the connection configuration is saved in the logic app resource or project's `connections.json` file, which contains a `managedApiConnections` JSON object that includes connection configuration information for each managed connector used in a workflow. For example, this connection information includes pointers to the connection's resource ID along with the managed identity properties, such as the resource ID, if the user-assigned identity is enabled.

This example shows what the configuration looks like when the logic app enables the *system-assigned* managed identity:

```json
{
    "managedApiConnections": {
        "<connector-name>": {
            "api": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{region}/managedApis/<connector-name>"
            },
            "authentication": { // Authentication for the internal token store
                "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
            },
            "connection": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/<connection-name>"
            },
            "connectionProperties": {
                "authentication": { // Authentication for the target resource
                    "audience": "<resource-URL>",
                    "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
                }
            },
            "connectionRuntimeUrl": "<connection-runtime-URL>"
        }
    }
}
```
     
This example shows what the configuration looks like when the logic app enables a *user-assigned* managed identity:

```json
{
    "managedApiConnections": {
        "<connector-name>": {
            "api": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{region}/managedApis/<connector-name>"
            },
            "authentication": { // Authentication for the internal token store

## ARM template for API connections and managed identities

If you use an ARM template to automate deployment, and your workflow includes an *API connection*, which is created by a [managed connector](../connectors/managed.md) such as Office 365 Outlook, Azure Key Vault, and so on that uses a managed identity, you have an extra step to take.

In this scenario, check that the underlying connection resource definition includes the `parameterValueSet` object, which includes the `name` property set to `managedIdentityAuth` and the `values` property set to an empty object. Otherwise, your ARM deployment won't set up the connection to use the managed identity for authentication, and the connection won't work in your workflow. This requirement applies only to [specific managed connector triggers and actions](#triggers-actions-managed-identity) where you selected the [**Connect with managed identity** option](#authenticate-managed-connector-managed-identity).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

For example, here's the underlying connection resource definition for an Azure Automation action in a Consumption logic app resource that uses a managed identity where the definition includes the `parameterValueType` property, which includes the `name` property set to `managedIdentityAuth` and the `values` property set to an empty object. Also note that the `apiVersion` property is set to `2018-07-01-preview`:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/connections",
    "name": "[variables('automationAccountApiConnectionName')]",
    "apiVersion": "2018-07-01-preview",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "kind": "V1",
    "properties": {
        "api": {
            "id": "[subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Web/locations/managedApis', parameters('location'), 'azureautomation')]"
        },
        "customParameterValues": {},
        "displayName": "[variables('automationAccountApiConnectionName')]",
        "parameterValueSet":{
            "name": "managedIdentityAuth",
            "values": {}
    }
},
```

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

For example, here's the underlying connection resource definition for an Azure Automation action in a Standard logic app resource that uses a managed identity where the definition includes the `parameterValueType` property, which is set to `Alternative`.

> [!NOTE]
> For Standard, the `kind` property is set to `V2`, and the `apiVersion` property is set to `2016-06-01`:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/connections",
    "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
    "name": "[variables('automationAccountApiConnectionName')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "kind": "V2",
    "properties": {
        "displayName": "[variables('automationAccountApiConnectionName')]",
        "parameterValueType": "Alternative",
        "api": {
            "id": "[subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Web/locations/managedApis', parameters('location'), 'azureautomation')]"
        }
    }
},
```

Following this `Microsoft.Web/connections` resource definition, make sure that you add an access policy that specifies a resource definition for each API connection and provide the following information:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| <*connection-name*> | The name for your API connection, for example, `office365` |
| <*object-ID*> | The object ID for your Azure AD identity, previously saved from your app registration |
| <*tenant-ID*> | The tenant ID for your Azure AD identity, previously saved from your app registration |
|||

```json
{
   "type": "Microsoft.Web/connections/accessPolicies",
   "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
   "name": "[concat('<connection-name>'),'/','<object-ID>')]",
   "location": "<location>",
   "dependsOn": [
      "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/connections', parameters('connection_name'))]"
   ],
   "properties": {
      "principal": {
         "type": "ActiveDirectory",
         "identity": {
            "objectId": "<object-ID>",
            "tenantId": "<tenant-ID>"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

For more information, review the [Microsoft.Web/connections/accesspolicies (ARM template)](/templates/microsoft.web/connections?tabs=json) documentation.

## Set up advanced control over API connection authentication

When your workflow uses an *API connection*, which is created by a [managed connector](../connectors/managed.md) such as Office 365 Outlook, Azure Key Vault, and so on, the Azure Logic Apps service communicates with the target resource, such as your email account, key vault, and so on, using two connections:

![Conceptual diagram showing first connection with authentication between logic app and token store plus second connection between token store and target resource.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/api-connection-authentication-flow.png)

* Connection #1 is set up with authentication for the internal token store.

* Connection #2 is set up with authentication for the target resource.

In a Consumption logic app resource, connection #1 is abstracted from you without any configuration options. In the Standard logic app resource type, you have more control over your logic app. By default, connection #1 is automatically set up to use the system-assigned identity.

However, if your scenario requires finer control over authenticating API connections, you can optionally change the authentication for connection #1 from the default system-assigned identity to any user-assigned identity that you've added to your logic app. This authentication applies to each API connection, so you can mix system-assigned and user-assigned identities across different connections to the same target resource.

In your Standard logic app **connections.json** file, which stores information about each API connection, each connection definition has two `authentication` sections, for example:

```json
"keyvault": {
   "api": {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{region}/managedApis/keyvault"
   },
   "authentication": {
      "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity",
   },
   "connection": {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/<connection-name>"
   },
   "connectionProperties": {
      "authentication": {
         "audience": "https://vault.azure.net",
         "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
      }
   },
   "connectionRuntimeUrl": "<connection-runtime-URL>"
}
```

* Mapped to connection #1, the first `authentication` section is the authentication used for communicating with the internal token store. In the past, this section was always set to `ManagedServiceIdentity` for an app that deploys to Azure and had no configurable options.

* Mapped to connection #2, the second `authentication` section is the authentication used for communicating with the target resource can vary, based on the authentication type that you select for that connection.

### Why change the authentication for the token store?

In some scenarios, you might want to share and use the same API connection across multiple logic apps, but not add the system-assigned identity for each logic app to the target resource's access policy.

In other scenarios, you might not want to have the system-assigned identity set up on your logic app entirely, so you can change the authentication to a user-assigned identity and disable the system-assigned identity completely.

### Change the authentication for the token store

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the resource menu, under **Workflows**, select **Connections**.

1. On the Connections pane, select **JSON View**.

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure portal, Standard logic app resource, "Connections" pane with "JSON View" selected.](./media/create-managed-service-identity/connections-json-view.png)

1. In the JSON editor, find the `managedApiConnections` section, which contains the API connections across all workflows in your logic app resource.

1. Find the connection where you want to add a user-assigned managed identity. For example, suppose your workflow has an Azure Key Vault connection:

   ```json
   "keyvault": {
      "api": {
         "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{region}/managedApis/keyvault"
      },
      "authentication": {
         "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
      },
      "connection": {
         "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/<connection-name>"
      },
      "connectionProperties": {
         "authentication": {
            "audience": "https://vault.azure.net",
            "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
         }
      },
      "connectionRuntimeUrl": "<connection-runtime-URL>"
   }
   ```

1. In the connection definition, complete the following steps:

   1. Find the first `authentication` section. If no `identity` property already exists in this `authentication` section, the logic app implicitly uses the system-assigned identity.

   1. Add an `identity` property by using the example in this step.

   1. Set the property value to the resource ID for the user-assigned identity.

   ```json
   "keyvault": {
      "api": {
         "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{region}/managedApis/keyvault"
      },
      "authentication": {
         "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity",
         // Add "identity" property here
         "identity": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{identity-resource-ID}" 
      },
      "connection": {
         "id": "/subscriptions/{Azure-subscription-ID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/<connection-name>"
      },
      "connectionProperties": {
         "authentication": {
            "audience": "https://vault.azure.net",
            "type": "ManagedServiceIdentity"
         }
      },
      "connectionRuntimeUrl": "<connection-runtime-URL>"
   }
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, go to the target resource, and [give access to the user-assigned managed identity](#access-other-resources), based on the target resource's needs.

   For example, for Azure Key Vault, add the identity to the key vault's access policies. For Azure Blob Storage, assign the necessary role for the identity to the storage account.

<a name="remove-identity"></a>

## Disable managed identity

To stop using the managed identity for authentication, first [remove the identity's access to the target resource](#disable-identity-target-resource). Next, on your logic app resource, [turn off the system-assigned identity or remove the user-assigned identity](#disable-identity-logic-app).

When you disable the managed identity on your logic app resource, you remove the capability for that identity to request access for Azure resources where the identity had access.

> [!NOTE]
> If you disable the system-assigned identity, any and all connections used by workflows in that 
> logic app's workflow won't work at runtime, even if you immediately enable the identity again. 
> This behavior happens because disabling the identity deletes the object ID. Each time that you 
> enable the identity, Azure generates the identity with a different and unique object ID. To resolve 
> this problem, you have to recreate the connections so that they use the current object ID for the 
> current system-assigned identity.
>
> Try to avoid disabling the system-assigned identity as much as possible. If you want to remove 
> the identity's access to Azure resources, remove the identity's role assignment from the target 
> resource. If you delete your logic app resource, Azure automatically removes the managed identity 
> from Azure AD.

The steps in this section cover using the [Azure portal](#azure-portal-disable) and [Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)](#template-disable). For Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure REST API, review the following documentation:

### Disable managed identity in the Azure portal

To remove access for the managed identity, remove the identity's role assignment from the target resource, and then disable the managed identity.

<a name="disable-identity-target-resource"></a>

#### Remove role assignment

The following steps remove access to the target resource from the managed identity:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the target Azure resource where you want to remove access for the managed identity.

1. From the target resource's menu, select **Access control (IAM)**. Under the toolbar, select **Role assignments**.

1. In the roles list, select the managed identities that you want to remove. On the toolbar, select **Remove**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If the **Remove** option is disabled, you most likely don't have permissions. 
   > For more information about the permissions that let you manage roles for resources, review 
   > [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md).

<a name="disable-identity-logic-app"></a>

#### Disable managed identity on logic app resource

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource.

1. On the logic app navigation menu, under **Settings**, select **Identity**, and then follow the steps for your identity:

   * Select **System assigned** > **On** > **Save**. When Azure prompts you to confirm, select **Yes**.

   * Select **User assigned** and the managed identity, and then select **Remove**. When Azure prompts you to confirm, select **Yes**.

<a name="template-disable"></a>

### Disable managed identity in an ARM template

If you created the logic app's managed identity by using an ARM template, set the `identity` object's `type` child property to `None`.

```json
"identity": {
   "type": "None"
}
```
