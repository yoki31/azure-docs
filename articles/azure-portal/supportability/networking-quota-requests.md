# Increase networking quotas

This article shows how to request increases for networking quotas in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

To view your current networking usage and quota in the Azure portal, open your subscription, then select **Usage + quotas**. You can also use the following options to view your network usage and limits.

- [Usage CLI](/cli/azure/network#az_network_list_usages)
- [PowerShell](/powershell/module/azurerm.network/get-azurermnetworkusage)
- [The network usage API](/rest/api/virtualnetwork/virtualnetworks/listusage)

You can request an increase in the Azure portal by using **Help + support** or in **Usage + quotas** for your subscription.
