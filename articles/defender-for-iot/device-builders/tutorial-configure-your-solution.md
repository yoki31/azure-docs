# Tutorial: Add a resource group to your IoT solution

This article explains how to add a resource group to your Microsoft Defender for IoT solution. To learn more about resource groups, see [Manage Azure Resource Manager resource groups by using the Azure portal](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md).

With Defender for IoT, you can monitor your entire IoT solution in one dashboard. From that dashboard, you can surface all of your IoT devices, IoT platforms, and back-end resources in Azure.

Once enabled, Defender for IoT will automatically identify other Azure services, and connect to related services that are affiliated with your IoT solution.

You can select other Azure resource groups that are part of your IoT solution. Your selections allow you to add entire subscriptions, resource groups, or single resources.

After defining all of the resource relationships, Defender for IoT will use Defender for Cloud to provide you security recommendations, and alerts for your resources.
