> [!NOTE]
> Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription does not meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, see [Standard quota: Increase limits by VM series](../../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md). Note that the free trial subscription isn't eligible for a quota increase, [upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) before requesting a quota increase.
