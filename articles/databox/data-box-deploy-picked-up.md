> * Erasure of data from Data Box

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

* You've have completed the [Tutorial: Copy data to Azure Data Box and verify](data-box-deploy-copy-data.md).
* Copy jobs are complete and there are no errors on the **Connect and copy** page. **Prepare to ship** can't run if copy jobs are in progress or there are errors in the **Connect and copy** page.

## Prepare to ship

[!INCLUDE [data-box-prepare-to-ship](../../includes/data-box-prepare-to-ship.md)]

After the data copy is complete, you prepare and ship the device. When the device reaches Azure datacenter, data is automatically uploaded to Azure.

## Prepare to ship

Before you prepare to ship, make sure that copy jobs are complete.

1. Go to **Prepare to ship** page in the local web UI and start the ship preparation.
2. Turn off the device from the local web UI. Remove the cables from the device.

The next steps are determined by where you're returning the device.

## Ship Data Box back

Make sure the data copy to the device completed and the **Prepare to ship** run was successful. 

Based on the region where you're shipping the device, the procedure is different. In many countries/regions, you can use [Microsoft managed shipping](#microsoft-managed-shipping) or [self-managed shipping](#self-managed-shipping).

### Microsoft managed shipping

Follow the guidelines for the region you're shipping from if you're using Microsoft managed shipping.

## [EU](#tab/in-europe)

[!INCLUDE [data-box-shipping-in-eu](../../includes/data-box-shipping-in-eu.md)]

**If you're shipping back to Azure datacenters in Germany or Switzerland,** you can also [use self-managed shipping](#self-managed-shipping).

## [UK](#tab/in-uk)

## Verify data upload to Azure

[!INCLUDE [data-box-verify-upload](../../includes/data-box-verify-upload.md)]

## Erasure of data from Data Box
 
Once the upload to Azure is complete, the Data Box erases the data on its disks as per the [NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2014/Released-SP-800-88-Revision-1,-Guidelines-for-Medi).
