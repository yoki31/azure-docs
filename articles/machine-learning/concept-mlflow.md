# MLflow and Azure Machine Learning

[MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org) is an open-source library for managing the life cycle of your machine learning experiments.  MLflow's tracking URI and logging API, collectively known as [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html#using-the-tracking-api) is a component of MLflow that logs and tracks your training run metrics and model artifacts, no matter your experiment's environment--locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, a virtual machine, or an Azure Databricks cluster. 

Together, MLflow Tracking and Azure Machine learning allow you to track an experiment's run metrics and store model artifacts in your Azure Machine Learning workspace. That experiment could've been run locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, a virtual machine, or an [Azure Databricks cluster](how-to-use-mlflow-azure-databricks.md). 

## Compare MLflow and Azure Machine Learning clients

 The following table summarizes the different clients that can use Azure Machine Learning, and their respective function capabilities.

 MLflow Tracking offers metric logging and artifact storage functionalities that are only otherwise available via the [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro).

## Track experiments

With MLflow Tracking you can connect Azure Machine Learning as the backend of your MLflow experiments. By doing so, you can do the following tasks,

+ Track and log experiment metrics and artifacts in your [Azure Machine Learning workspace](./concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md#workspace). If you already use MLflow Tracking for your experiments, the workspace provides a centralized, secure, and scalable location to store training metrics and models. 

+ Track and manage models in MLflow and Azure Machine Learning model registry.

+ [Track Azure Databricks training runs](how-to-use-mlflow-azure-databricks.md).

## Train MLflow projects (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

You can use MLflow's tracking URI and logging API, collectively known as MLflow Tracking, to submit training jobs with [MLflow Projects](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) and Azure Machine Learning backend support (preview). You can submit jobs locally with Azure Machine Learning tracking or migrate your runs to the cloud like via an [Azure Machine Learning Compute](./how-to-create-attach-compute-cluster.md).

## Deploy MLflow experiments

You can [deploy your MLflow model as an Azure web service](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models.md), so you can leverage and apply Azure Machine Learning's model management and data drift detection capabilities to your production models.
