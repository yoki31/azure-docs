# Save and share customized views

Cost analysis is used to explore costs and get quick answers for things like finding the top cost contributors or understanding how you're charged for the services you use. As you analyze cost, you may find specific views you want to save or share with others.

## Save and share cost views

A *view* is a saved query in Cost Management. When you save a view, all settings in cost analysis are saved, including filters, grouping, granularity, the main chart type, and donut charts. Underlying data isn't saved. Only you can see private views, while everyone with Cost Management Reader access or greater to the scope can see shared views.

Check out the [Sharing and saving views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQkXXj-SmvQ) video.

After you save a view, you can share a link to it with others using the **Share** command. The link is specific to your current scope and view configuration. The link doesn't grant others access to the view itself, which may change over time, or the underlying data. If you don't have access to the scope, you'll see an `access denied` message. We recommend using the Cost Management Contributor role to allow others to save and share views with others.

You can also pin the current view to an Azure portal dashboard. This only includes a snapshot of the main chart or table and doesn't update when the view is updated. A pinned dashboard isn't the same thing as a saved view.

### To save a view

1. In cost analysis, make sure that the settings that you want saved are chosen.
1. Select the **Save** command at the top of the page to update your current view or **Save as** to save a new view.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/save-options.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the view save options." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/save-options.png" :::
1. Enter a name for the view and then select **Save**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/save-box.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing Save box where you enter a name to save." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/save-box.png" :::
1. After you save a view, it's available to select from the **View** menu.  
     :::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/view-list.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the View list." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/view-list.png" :::

### To share a view

1. In cost analysis, ensure that the currently selected view is the one that you want to share.
1. Select the **Share** command at the top of the page.
1. In the **Share** box, copy the URL and then select **OK**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/share.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the Share box." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/share.png" :::
1. You can paste the URL using any application that you like to send to others.

If you need to generate a link to a view programmatically, use one of the following formats:

- View configuration – `https://<portal-domain>/@<directory-domain>/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/open/costanalysis/scope/<scope-id>/view/<view-config>`
- Saved view – `https://<portal-domain>/@<directory-domain>/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/open/costanalysis/scope/<scope-id>/viewId/<view-id>`


Use the following table for each property in the URL.

| URL property | Description|
| --- | --- |
| **portal-domain** | Primary domain for the Azure portal. For example, `portal.azure.com` or `portal.azure.us`). |
| **directory-domain** | Domain used by your Azure Active Directory. You can also use the tenant ID. If it is omitted, the portal tries to use the default directory for the user that selected the link - it might  differ from the scope. |
| **scope-id** | Full Resource Manager ID for the resource group, subscription, management group, or billing account you want to view cost for. If not specified, Cost Management uses the last view the user used in the Azure portal. The value must be URL encoded. |
| **view-config** | Encoded view configuration. See details below. If not specified, cost analysis uses the `view-id` parameter. If neither are specified, cost analysis uses the built-in Accumulated cost view. |
| **view-id** | Full Resource Manager ID for the private or shared view to load. This value must be URL encoded. If not specified, cost analysis uses the `view` parameter. If neither are specified, cost analysis uses the built-in Accumulated cost view. |

The `view-config` parameter is an encoded version of the JSON view configuration. For more information about the view body, see the [Views API reference](/rest/api/cost-management/views). To learn how to build specific customizations, pin the desired view to an empty Azure portal dashboard, then download the dashboard JSON to review the JSON view configuration.

After you have the desired view configuration:

1. Use Base 64 encode for the JSON view configuration.
1. Use Gzip to compress the encoded string.
1. URL encode the compressed string.
1. Add the final encoded string to the URL after the `/view/` parameter.

## Pin a view to the Azure portal dashboard

As mentioned previously, pinning a view to an Azure portal dashboard only saves the main chart or table. It's essentially a thumbnail you can select to get back to the view configuration in cost analysis. Keep in mind the dashboard tile is a copy of your view configuration – if you save a view that was previously pinned, the pinned tile doesn't update. To update the tile, pin the saved view again.

### To pin cost analysis to a dashboard

1. In cost analysis, ensure that the currently selected view is the one that you want to pin.
1. To the right of your billing scope or subscription name, select the **Pin** symbol.
1. In the Pin to dashboard window, choose **Existing** to pin the current view to the existing dashboard or choose **Create new** to pin the current view to a new dashboard.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/pin-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the Pin to dashboard page." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/pin-dashboard.png" :::
1. Select **Private** to if you don't want to share the dashboard and then select **Pin** or select **Shared** to share the dashboard with others and then select **Pin**.

To view the dashboard after you've pinned it, from the Azure portal menu, select **Dashboard**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/saved-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the saved Dashboard page." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/saved-dashboard.png" :::

### To rename a tile

1. From the dashboard where your tile is pinned, select the title of the tile you want to rename. This action opens cost analysis with that view. 
1. Select the **Save** command at the top of the page.
1. Enter the name of the tile you want to use.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select the **Pin** symbol to the right of the page header.
1. From the dashboard, you can now remove the original tile.

For more advanced dashboard customizations, you can also export the dashboard, customize the dashboard JSON, and upload a new dashboard. This can include additional tile sizes or names without saving new views. For more information, see [Create a dashboard in the Azure portal](../../azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards.md).

## Download data or charts

When you want to share information with others that don't have access to the scope, you can download the view in PNG, Excel, and CSV formats. Then you can share it with them by email or other means. The downloaded data is a snapshot, so it isn't automatically updated.

:::image type="content" source="./media/save-share-views/download.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the Download page." lightbox="./media/save-share-views/download.png" :::

When downloading data, cost analysis includes summarized data as it's shown in the table. The cost by resource view includes all resource meters in addition to the resource details. If you want a download of only resources and not the nested meters, use the cost analysis preview. You can access the preview from the **Cost by resource** menu at the top of the page, where you can select the Resources, Resource groups, Subscriptions, Services, or Reservations view.

If you need more advanced summaries or you're interested in raw data that hasn't been summarized, schedule an export to publish raw data to a storage account on a recurring basis.

## Subscribe to cost alerts

In addition to saving and opening views repeatedly or sharing them with others manually, you can also subscribe to updates or a recurring schedule to get alerted as costs change. You can also set up alerts to be shared with others who may not have direct access to costs in the portal. 

### To subscribe to cost alerts

1. In cost analysis, select a private or shared view you want to subscribe to alerts for or create and save a new chart view.
1. Select **Subscribe** at the top of the page.
1. Select **+ Add** at the top of the list of alerts.
1. Specify the desired email settings and select **Save**.
    - The **Name** helps you distinguish the different emails setup for the current view. Use it to indicate audience or purpose of this specific email.
    - The **Subject** is what people will see when they receive the email.
   - You can include up to 20 recipients. Consider using a distribution list if you have a large audience. To see how the email looks, start by sending it only to yourself. You can update it later.
    - The **Message** is shown in the email to give people some additional context about why they're receiving the email. You may want to include what it covers, who requested it, or who to contact to make changes.
    - If you want to include an unauthenticated link to the data (for people who don't have access to the scope/view), select **CSV** in the **Include link to data** list.
    - If you want to allow people who have write access to the scope to change the email configuration settings, check the **Allow contributors to change these settings** option. For example, you might to allow billing account admins or Cost Management Contributors. By default it is unselected and only you can see or edit the scheduled email.
    - The **Start date** is when you'll start receiving the email. It defaults to the current day.
    - The **End date** is when you'll receive the last email. It can be up to one year from the current day, which is the default. You can update this later.
    - The **Frequency** indicates how often you want the email to be sent. It's based on the start date, so if want a weekly email on a different day of the week, change the start date first. To get an email after the month is closed, select **After invoice finalized**. Ensure your view is looking at last month. If you use the current month, it will only send you the first few days of the month. By default, all emails are sent at 8:00 AM local time. To customize any of the options, select **Custom**.
1. After saving your alert, you'll see a list of configured alerts for the current view. If want to see a preview of the email, select the row and select **Send now** at the top to send the email to all recipients.

Keep in mind that if you choose to include a link to data, anyone who receives the email will have access to the data included in that email. Data expires after seven days.
