# Automanage devices in Azure Digital Twins using Device Provisioning Service (DPS)

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Azure Digital Twins with [Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md).

The solution described in this article will allow you to automate the process to **_provision_** and **_retire_** IoT Hub devices in Azure Digital Twins, using Device Provisioning Service. 

For more information about the _provision_ and _retire_ stages, and to better understand the set of general device management stages that are common to all enterprise IoT projects, see the [Device lifecycle section](../iot-hub/iot-hub-device-management-overview.md#device-lifecycle) of IoT Hub's device management documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you can set up the provisioning, you'll need to set up the following resources:
* An **Azure Digital Twins instance**. Follow the instructions in [Set up an instance and authentication](how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md) to create an Azure digital twins instance. Gather the instance's **_host name_** in the Azure portal ([instructions](how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values)).
* An **IoT hub**. For instructions, see the "Create an IoT Hub" section of [the IoT Hub quickstart](../iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-cli.md).
* An [Azure function](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) that updates digital twin information based on IoT Hub data. Follow the instructions in [Ingest IoT hub data](how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data.md) to create this Azure function. Gather the function **_name_** to use it in this article.

This sample also uses a **device simulator** that includes provisioning using the Device Provisioning Service. The device simulator is located here: [Azure Digital Twins and IoT Hub Integration Sample](/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-iothub-integration/adt-iothub-provision-sample/). Get the sample project on your machine by navigating to the sample link and selecting the **Browse code** button underneath the title. This button will take you to the GitHub repo for the sample, which you can download as a .zip file by selecting the **Code** button and **Download ZIP**. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/download-repo-zip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the digital-twins-iothub-integration repo on GitHub, highlighting the steps to download it as a zip." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/download-repo-zip.png":::

Unzip the downloaded folder.

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download) installed on your machine. The device simulator is based on **Node.js**, version 10.0.x or later.

## Solution architecture

This solution includes steps for provisioning and retiring a device in Azure Digital Twins, using Device Provisioning Service.

To allocate devices in the solution, data flows between a thermostat device and DPS. The data then flows from DPS into IoT Hub, and to Azure Digital Twins through an Azure function.

To retire a device, data from a manual device deletion flows into Azure Digital Twins through IoT Hub, Event Hubs, and an Azure function.

The image below illustrates this architecture.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/flows.png" alt-text="Diagram of device and several Azure services in an end-to-end scenario showing the data flow." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/flows.png":::

This article is divided into two sections, each focused on a portion of this full architecture:
* [Autoprovision device using Device Provisioning Service](#autoprovision-device-using-device-provisioning-service)
* [Autoretire device using IoT Hub lifecycle events](#autoretire-device-using-iot-hub-lifecycle-events)

## Autoprovision device using Device Provisioning Service

In this section, you'll be attaching Device Provisioning Service to Azure Digital Twins to autoprovision devices through the path below. This diagram is an excerpt from the full architecture shown [earlier](#solution-architecture).

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/provision.png" alt-text="Diagram of Provision flowâ€”an excerpt of the solution architecture diagram following data from a thermostat into Azure Digital Twins." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/provision.png":::

Here's a description of the process flow:
1. Device contacts the DPS endpoint, passing identifying information to prove its identity.
2. DPS validates device identity by validating the registration ID and key against the enrollment list, and calls an [Azure function](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) to do the allocation.
3. The Azure function creates a new [twin](concepts-twins-graph.md) in Azure Digital Twins for the device. The twin will have the same name as the device's **registration ID**.
4. DPS registers the device with an IoT hub, and populates the device's chosen twin state.
5. The IoT hub returns device ID information and the IoT hub connection information to the device. The device can now connect to the IoT hub.

The following sections walk through the steps to set up this autoprovision device flow.

### Create a Device Provisioning Service

When a new device is provisioned using Device Provisioning Service, a new twin for that device can be created in Azure Digital Twins with the same name as the registration ID.

Create a Device Provisioning Service instance, which will be used to provision IoT devices. You can either use the Azure CLI instructions below, or use the Azure portal by following [Set up the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](../iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision.md).

The following Azure CLI command will create a Device Provisioning Service. You'll need to specify a Device Provisioning Service name, resource group, and region. To see what regions support Device Provisioning Service, visit [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=iot-hub).
The command can be run in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com), or locally if you have the [Azure CLI installed on your machine](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

```azurecli-interactive
az iot dps create --name <Device-Provisioning-Service-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <region>
```

### Add a function to use with Device Provisioning Service

Inside your function app project that you created in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites), you'll create a new function to use with the Device Provisioning Service. This function will be used by the Device Provisioning Service in a [Custom Allocation Policy](../iot-dps/how-to-use-custom-allocation-policies.md) to provision a new device.

Start by opening the function app project in Visual Studio on your machine and follow the steps below.

1. First, create a new function of type *HTTP-trigger* in the function app project in Visual Studio. For instructions on how to create this function, see [Develop Azure Functions using Visual Studio](../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md#add-a-function-to-your-project).

2. Add a new NuGet package to the project: [Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service/). You might need to add more packages to your project as well, if the packages used in the code aren't part of the project already.

3. In the newly created function code file, paste in the following code, rename the function to *DpsAdtAllocationFunc.cs*, and save the file.

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples-dps/functions/DpsAdtAllocationFunc.cs":::

4. Publish the project with the *DpsAdtAllocationFunc.cs* function to a function app in Azure. For instructions on how to publish the project, see [Develop Azure Functions using Visual Studio](../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md#publish-to-azure).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When creating the function app for the first time in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites), you may have already assigned an access role for the function and configured the application settings for it to access your Azure Digital Twins instance. These need to be done once for the entire function app, so verify they've been completed in your app before continuing. You can find instructions in the [Configure published app](how-to-authenticate-client.md#configure-published-app) section of the *Write app authentication code* article.

### Create Device Provisioning enrollment

Next, you'll need to create an enrollment in Device Provisioning Service using a **custom allocation function**. To create an enrollment, follow the instructions in the [Create the enrollment](../iot-dps/how-to-use-custom-allocation-policies.md#create-the-enrollment) section of the custom allocation policies article in the Device Provisioning Service documentation.

While going through that flow, make sure you select the following options to link the enrollment to the function you created.

* **Select how you want to assign devices to hubs**: Custom (Use Azure Function).
* **Select the IoT hubs this group can be assigned to:** Choose your IoT hub name or select the *Link a new IoT hub* button, and choose your IoT hub from the dropdown.

Next, choose the *Select a new function* button to link your function app to the enrollment group. Then, fill in the following values:

* **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription is autopopulated. Make sure it's the right subscription.
* **Function App**: Choose your function app name.
* **Function**: Choose DpsAdtAllocationFunc.

Save your details.                  

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/link-enrollment-group-to-iot-hub-and-function-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Customs enrollment group details window in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/link-enrollment-group-to-iot-hub-and-function-app.png":::

After creating the enrollment, the **Primary Key** for the enrollment will be used later to configure the device simulator for this article.

### Set up the device simulator

This sample uses a device simulator that includes provisioning using the Device Provisioning Service. The device simulator is located in the [Azure Digital Twins and IoT Hub Integration Sample](/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-iothub-integration/adt-iothub-provision-sample/) that you downloaded in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

#### Upload the model

The device simulator is a thermostat-type device that uses the model with this ID: `dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1`. You'll need to upload this model to Azure Digital Twins before you can create a twin of this type for the device.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-thermostat-model-upload.md](../../includes/digital-twins-thermostat-model-upload.md)]

For more information about models, see [Manage models](how-to-manage-model.md#upload-models).

#### Configure and run the simulator

In your command window, navigate to the downloaded sample *Azure Digital Twins and IoT Hub Integration* that you unzipped earlier, and then into the *device-simulator* directory. Next, install the dependencies for the project using the following command:

```cmd
npm install
```

Next, in your device simulator directory, copy the .env.template file to a new file called .env, and gather the following values to fill in the settings:

* PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE: To get this value, navigate to your device provisioning service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), then select *Overview* in the menu options and look for the field *ID Scope*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal view of the device provisioning overview page highlighting the ID Scope value." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/id-scope.png":::

* PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID: You can choose a registration ID for your device.
* ADT_MODEL_ID: `dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1`
* PROVISIONING_SYMMETRIC_KEY: This environment variable is the primary key for the enrollment you set up earlier. To get this value again, navigate to your device provisioning service in the Azure portal, select *Manage enrollments*, then select the enrollment group that you created earlier and copy the *Primary Key*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/sas-primary-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal view of the device provisioning service manage enrollments page highlighting the SAS primary key value." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/sas-primary-key.png":::

Now, use the values above to update the .env file settings.

```cmd
PROVISIONING_HOST = "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net"
PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE = "<Device-Provisioning-Service-Scope-ID>"
PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID = "<Device-Registration-ID>"
ADT_MODEL_ID = "dtmi:contosocom:DigitalTwins:Thermostat;1"
PROVISIONING_SYMMETRIC_KEY = "<Device-Provisioning-Service-enrollment-primary-SAS-key>"
```

Save and close the file.

### Start running the device simulator

Still in the *device-simulator* directory in your command window, start the device simulator using the following command:

```cmd
node .\adt_custom_register.js
```

You should see the device being registered and connected to IoT Hub, and then starting to send messages.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Command window showing device registration and sending messages." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/output.png":::

### Validate

The flow you've set up in this article will result in the device automatically being registered in Azure Digital Twins. Use the following [Azure Digital Twins CLI](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az_dt_twin_show) command to find the twin of the device in the Azure Digital Twins instance you created.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt twin show --dt-name <Digital-Twins-instance-name> --twin-id "<Device-Registration-ID>"
```

You should see the twin of the device being found in the Azure Digital Twins instance.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/show-provisioned-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Command window showing newly created twin." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/show-provisioned-twin.png":::

## Autoretire device using IoT Hub lifecycle events

In this section, you'll be attaching IoT Hub lifecycle events to Azure Digital Twins to autoretire devices through the path below. This diagram is an excerpt from the full architecture shown [earlier](#solution-architecture).

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/retire.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Retire device flowâ€”an excerpt of the solution architecture diagram, following data from a device deletion into Azure Digital Twins." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/retire.png":::

Here's a description of the process flow:
1. An external or manual process triggers the deletion of a device in IoT Hub.
2. IoT Hub deletes the device and generates a [device lifecycle](../iot-hub/iot-hub-device-management-overview.md#device-lifecycle) event that will be routed to an [event hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md).
3. An Azure function deletes the twin of the device in Azure Digital Twins.

The following sections walk through the steps to set up this autoretire device flow.

### Create an event hub

Next, you'll create an Azure [event hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md) to receive IoT Hub lifecycle events. 

Follow the steps described in the [Create an event hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md) quickstart. Name your event hub *lifecycleevents*. You'll use this event hub name when you set up IoT Hub route and an Azure function in the next sections.

The screenshot below illustrates the creation of the event hub.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/create-event-hub-lifecycle-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal window showing how to create an event hub with the name lifecycleevents." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/create-event-hub-lifecycle-events.png":::

#### Create SAS policy for your event hub

Next, you'll need to create a [shared access signature (SAS) policy](../event-hubs/authorize-access-shared-access-signature.md) to configure the event hub with your function app.
To create the SAS policy:
1. Navigate to the event hub you created in the Azure portal and select **Shared access policies** in the menu options on the left.
2. Select **Add**. In the *Add SAS Policy* window that opens, enter a policy name of your choice and select the *Listen* checkbox.
3. Select **Create**.
    
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/add-event-hub-sas-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to add an event hub SAS policy." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/add-event-hub-sas-policy.png":::

#### Configure event hub with function app

Next, configure the Azure function app that you set up in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites) to work with your new event hub. You'll configure the function by setting an environment variable inside the function app with the event hub's connection string.

1. Open the policy that you created and copy the **Connection string-primary key** value.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/event-hub-sas-policy-connection-string.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to copy the connection string-primary key." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/event-hub-sas-policy-connection-string.png":::

2. Add the connection string as a variable in the function app settings with the following Azure CLI command. The command can be run in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com), or locally if you have the [Azure CLI installed on your machine](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings "EVENTHUB_CONNECTIONSTRING=<Event-Hubs-SAS-connection-string-Listen>" --resource-group <resource-group> --name <your-function-app-name>
    ```

### Add a function to retire with IoT Hub lifecycle events

Inside your function app project that you created in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites), you'll create a new function to retire an existing device using IoT Hub lifecycle events.

For more about lifecycle events, see [IoT Hub Non-telemetry events](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md#non-telemetry-events). For more information about using Event Hubs with Azure functions, see [Azure Event Hubs trigger for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-hubs-trigger.md).

Start by opening the function app project in Visual Studio on your machine and follow the steps below.

1. First, create a new function of type *Event Hub Trigger* in the function app project in Visual Studio. For instructions on how to create this function, see [Develop Azure Functions using Visual Studio](../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md#add-a-function-to-your-project).

2. Add a new NuGet package to the project: [Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service/). You might need to add more packages to your project as well, if the packages used in the code aren't part of the project already.

3. In the newly created function code file, paste in the following code, rename the function to *DeleteDeviceInTwinFunc.cs*, and save the file.

    :::code language="csharp" source="~/digital-twins-docs-samples-dps/functions/DeleteDeviceInTwinFunc.cs":::

4. Publish the project with the *DeleteDeviceInTwinFunc.cs* function to a function app in Azure. For instructions on how to publish the project, see [Develop Azure Functions using Visual Studio](../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md#publish-to-azure).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When creating the function app for the first time in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites), you may have already assigned an access role for the function and configured the application settings for it to access your Azure Digital Twins instance. These need to be done once for the entire function app, so verify they've been completed in your app before continuing. You can find instructions in the [Configure published app](how-to-authenticate-client.md#configure-published-app) section of the *Write app authentication code* article.

### Create an IoT Hub route for lifecycle events

Now you'll set up an IoT Hub route, to route device lifecycle events. In this case, you'll specifically listen to device delete events, identified by `if (opType == "deleteDeviceIdentity")`. This event will trigger the delete of the digital twin item, completing the retirement process of a device and its digital twin.

First, you'll need to create an event hub endpoint in your IoT hub. Then, you'll add a route in IoT hub to send lifecycle events to this event hub endpoint.
Follow these steps to create an event hub endpoint:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the IoT hub you created in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites) and select **Message routing** in the menu options on the left.
2. Select the **Custom endpoints** tab.
3. Select **+ Add** and choose **Event hubs** to add an Event Hubs type endpoint.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/event-hub-custom-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio window showing how to add an event hub custom endpoint." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/event-hub-custom-endpoint.png":::

4. In the window *Add an event hub endpoint* that opens, choose the following values:
    * **Endpoint name**: Choose an endpoint name.
    * **Event hub namespace**: Select your event hub namespace from the dropdown list.
    * **Event hub instance**: Choose the event hub name that you created in the previous step.
5. Select **Create**. Keep this window open to add a route in the next step.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/add-event-hub-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio window showing how to add an event hub endpoint." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/add-event-hub-endpoint.png":::

Next, you'll add a route that connects to the endpoint you created in the above step, with a routing query that sends the delete events. Follow these steps to create a route:

1. Navigate to the *Routes* tab and select **Add** to add a route.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/add-message-route.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio window showing how to add a route to send events." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/add-message-route.png":::

2. In the *Add a route* page that opens, choose the following values:

   * **Name**: Choose a name for your route. 
   * **Endpoint**: Choose the Event Hubs endpoint you created earlier from the dropdown.
   * **Data source**: Choose *Device Lifecycle Events*.
   * **Routing query**: Enter `opType='deleteDeviceIdentity'`. This query limits the device lifecycle events to only send the delete events.

3. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/lifecycle-route.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal window showing how to add a route to send lifecycle events." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/lifecycle-route.png":::

Once you've gone through this flow, everything is set to retire devices end-to-end.

### Validate

To trigger the process of retirement, you need to manually delete the device from IoT Hub.

You can manually delete the device from IoT Hub with an [Azure CLI command](/cli/azure/iot/hub/module-identity#az_iot_hub_module_identity_delete) or in the Azure portal. 
Follow the steps below to delete the device in the Azure portal:

1. Navigate to your IoT hub, and choose **IoT devices** in the menu options on the left. 
2. You'll see a device with the device registration ID you chose in the [first half of this article](#autoprovision-device-using-device-provisioning-service). You can also choose any other device to delete, as long as it has a twin in Azure Digital Twins so you can verify that the twin is automatically deleted after the device is deleted.
3. Select the device and choose **Delete**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/delete-device-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to delete device twin from the IoT devices." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/delete-device-twin.png":::

It might take a few minutes to see the changes reflected in Azure Digital Twins.

Use the following [Azure Digital Twins CLI](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az_dt_twin_show) command to verify the twin of the device in the Azure Digital Twins instance was deleted.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt twin show --dt-name <Digital-Twins-instance-name> --twin-id "<Device-Registration-ID>"
```

You should see that the twin of the device cannot be found in the Azure Digital Twins instance anymore.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/show-retired-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Command window showing that the twin can't be found anymore." lightbox="media/how-to-provision-using-device-provisioning-service/show-retired-twin.png":::

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the resources created in this article, follow these steps to delete them.

Using the Azure Cloud Shell or local Azure CLI, you can delete all Azure resources in a resource group with the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az_group_delete) command. This command removes the resource group; the Azure Digital Twins instance; the IoT hub and the hub device registration; the Event Grid topic and associated subscriptions; the Event Hubs namespace and both Azure Functions apps, including associated resources like storage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. 

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name <your-resource-group>
```

Then, delete the project sample folder you downloaded from your local machine.

## Next steps

The digital twins created for the devices are stored as a flat hierarchy in Azure Digital Twins, but they can be enriched with model information and a multi-level hierarchy for organization. To learn more about this concept, read:

* [Digital twins and the twin graph](concepts-twins-graph.md)

For more information about using HTTP requests with Azure functions, see:

* [Azure Http request trigger for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md)

You can write custom logic to automatically provide this information using the model and graph data already stored in Azure Digital Twins. To read more about managing, upgrading, and retrieving information from the twins graph, see the following how-to guides:

* [Manage a digital twin](how-to-manage-twin.md)
* [Query the twin graph](how-to-query-graph.md)
