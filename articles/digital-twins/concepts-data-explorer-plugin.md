# Azure Digital Twins query plugin for Azure Data Explorer

This article explains about the Azure Digital Twin query plugin for [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview), how to use Azure Data Explorer IoT data with Azure Digital Twins, how to map data across Azure Data Explorer and Azure Digital Twins, and more.

The Azure Digital Twins plugin for [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) lets you run Azure Data Explorer queries that access and combine data across the Azure Digital Twins graph and Azure Data Explorer time series databases. Use the plugin to contextualize disparate time series data by reasoning across digital twins and their relationships to gain insights into the behavior of modeled environments.

For example, with this plugin, you can write a Kusto query that:
1. Selects digital twins of interest via the Azure Digital Twins query plugin,
2. Joins those twins against the respective times series in Azure Data Explorer, and then 
3. Performs advanced time series analytics on those twins.  

Combining data from a twin graph in Azure Digital Twins with time series data in Azure Data Explorer can help you understand the operational behavior of various parts of your solution. 

## Using the plugin

You can invoke the plugin in a Kusto query with the following command. There are two placeholders, `<Azure-Digital-Twins-endpoint>` and `<Azure-Digital-Twins-query>`, which are strings representing the Azure Digital Twins instance endpoint and Azure Digital Twins query, respectively. 

```kusto
evaluate azure_digital_twins_query_request(<Azure-Digital-Twins-endpoint>, <Azure-Digital-Twins-query>) 
```

The plugin works by calling the [Azure Digital Twins query API](/rest/api/digital-twins/dataplane/query), and the [query language structure](concepts-query-language.md) is the same as when using the API, with two exceptions: 
* The `*` wildcard in the `SELECT` clause isn't supported. Instead, Azure Digital Twin queries that are executed using the plugin should use aliases in the `SELECT` clause.

    For example, consider the below Azure Digital Twins query that is executed using the API:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM DIGITALTWINS
    ```
    
    To execute that query when using the plugin, it should be rewritten like this:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT T FROM DIGITALTWINS T
    ```
* Column names returned by the plugin may not start with a `$`. Using aliases in the `SELECT` clause will also help to avoid this scenario.

    For example, consider the below Azure Digital Twins query that is executed using the API:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT T.$dtId, T.Temperature FROM DIGITALTWINS T
    ```
    
    To execute that query when using the plugin, it should be rewritten like this:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT T.$dtId as tid, T.Temperature FROM DIGITALTWINS T
    ```


>[!IMPORTANT]
>The user of the plugin must be granted the **Azure Digital Twins Data Reader** role or the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role, as the user's Azure AD token is used to authenticate. Information on how to assign this role can be found in [Security for Azure Digital Twins solutions](concepts-security.md#authorization-azure-roles-for-azure-digital-twins).

For more information on using the plugin, see the [Kusto documentation for the azure_digital_twins_query_request plugin](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/azure-digital-twins-query-request-plugin).

## Using Azure Data Explorer IoT data with Azure Digital Twins

There are various ways to ingest IoT data into Azure Data Explorer. Here are two of them that you might take advantage of when using Azure Data Explorer with Azure Digital Twins:
* Create a history record of digital twin property values in Azure Data Explorer with an Azure function that handles twin change events and writes the twin data to Azure Data Explorer. This process is similar to the one used in [Integrate with Azure Time Series Insights](how-to-integrate-time-series-insights.md). This path will be suitable for customers who use telemetry data to bring their digital twins to life.
* [Ingest IoT data directly into your Azure Data Explorer cluster from IoT Hub](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-iot-hub) or from other sources. Then, the Azure Digital Twins graph will be used to contextualize the time series data using joint Azure Digital Twins/Azure Data Explorer queries. This path may be suitable for direct-ingestion workloads. 

### Mapping data across Azure Data Explorer and Azure Digital Twins

If you're ingesting time series data directly into Azure Data Explorer, you'll likely need to convert this raw time series data into a schema suitable for joint Azure Digital Twins/Azure Data Explorer queries.

An [update policy](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/updatepolicy) in Azure Data Explorer allows you to automatically transform and append data to a target table whenever new data is inserted into a source table. 

You can use an update policy to enrich your raw time series data with the corresponding **twin ID** from Azure Digital Twins, and persist it to a target table. Using the twin ID, the target table can then be joined against the digital twins selected by the Azure Digital Twins plugin. 

For example, say you created the following table to hold the raw time series data flowing into your Azure Data Explorer instance. 

```kusto
.create-merge table rawData (Timestamp:datetime, someId:string, Value:string, ValueType:string)  
```

You could create a mapping table to relate time series IDs with twin IDs, and other optional fields. 

```kusto
.create-merge table mappingTable (someId:string, twinId:string, otherMetadata:string) 
```

Then, create a target table to hold the enriched time series data. 

```kusto
.create-merge table timeseriesSilver (twinId:string, Timestamp:datetime, someId:string, otherMetadata:string, ValueNumeric:real, ValueString:string)  
```

Next, create a function `Update_rawData` to enrich the raw data by joining it with the mapping table. Doing so will add the twin ID to the resulting target table. 

```kusto
.create-or-alter function with (folder = "Update", skipvalidation = "true") Update_rawData() { 
rawData 
| join kind=leftouter mappingTable on someId 
| project 
    Timestamp, ValueNumeric = toreal(Value), ValueString = Value, ... 
} 
```

Lastly, create an update policy to call the function and update the target table. 

```kusto
.alter table timeseriesSilver policy update 
@'[{"IsEnabled": true, "Source": "rawData", "Query": "Update_rawData()", "IsTransactional": false, "PropagateIngestionProperties": false}]' 
```

Once the target table is created, you can use the Azure Digital Twins plugin to select twins of interest and then join them against time series data in the target table. 

### Example schema

Here's an example of a schema that might be used to represent shared data.

| timestamp | twinId | modelId | name | value | relationshipTarget | relationshipID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2021-02-01 17:24 | ConfRoomTempSensor | dtmi:com:example:TemperatureSensor;1 | temperature | 301.0 |  |  |

Digital twin properties are stored as key-value pairs (`name, value`). `name` and `value` are stored as dynamic data types. 

The schema also supports storing properties for relationships, per the `relationshipTarget` and `relationshipID` fields. The key-value schema avoids the need to create a column for each twin property.

### Representing properties with multiple fields 

You may want to store a property in your schema with multiple fields. These properties are represented by storing a JSON object as `value` in your schema.

For instance, if you want to represent a property with three fields for roll, pitch, and yaw, the value object would look like this: `{"roll": 20, "pitch": 15, "yaw": 45}`.
