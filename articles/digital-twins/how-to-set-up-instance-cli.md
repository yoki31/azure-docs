# Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance and authentication (CLI)

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-setup-selector.md](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-selector.md)]

This article covers the steps to **set up a new Azure Digital Twins instance**, including creating the instance and setting up authentication. After completing this article, you'll have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to start programming against.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-setup-steps.md](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-steps.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

[!INCLUDE [CLI setup for Azure Digital Twins](../../includes/digital-twins-cli.md)]

## Create the Azure Digital Twins instance

In this section, you will **create a new instance of Azure Digital Twins** using the CLI command. You will need to provide:
* A resource group where the instance will be deployed. If you do not already have an existing resource group in mind, you can create one now with this command:
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --location <region> --name <name-for-your-resource-group>
    ```
* A region for the deployment. To see what regions support Azure Digital Twins, visit [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=digital-twins).
* A name for your instance. If your subscription has another Azure Digital Twins instance in the region that is
  already using the specified name, you'll be asked to pick a different name.

Use these values in the following [az dt command](/cli/azure/dt) to create the instance:

```azurecli-interactive
az dt create --dt-name <name-for-your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --location <region>
```

### Verify success and collect important values

If the instance was created successfully, the result in the CLI looks something like this, outputting information about the resource you have created:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-instance/cloud-shell/create-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Cloud Shell window with successful creation of a resource group and Azure Digital Twins instance in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/how-to-set-up-instance/cloud-shell/create-instance.png":::

Note the Azure Digital Twins instance's **hostName**, **name**, and **resourceGroup** from the output. These values are all important and you may need to use them as you continue working with your Azure Digital Twins instance, to set up authentication and related Azure resources. If other users will be programming against the instance, you should share these values with them.

> [!TIP]
> You can see these properties, along with all the properties of your instance, at any time by running `az dt show --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance>`.

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go. Next, you will give the appropriate Azure user permissions to manage it.

## Set up user access permissions

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-setup-role-assignment.md](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-role-assignment.md)]

### Prerequisites: Permission requirements

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-setup-permissions.md](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-permissions.md)]

### Assign the role

To give a user permission to manage an Azure Digital Twins instance, you must assign them the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role within the instance.

Use the following command to assign the role (must be run by a user with [sufficient permissions](#prerequisites-permission-requirements) in the Azure subscription). The command requires you to pass in the *user principal name* on the Azure AD account for the user that should be assigned the role. In most cases, this value will match the user's email on the Azure AD account.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt role-assignment create --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --assignee "<Azure-AD-user-principal-name-of-user-to-assign>" --role "Azure Digital Twins Data Owner"
```

The result of this command is outputted information about the role assignment that has been created for the user.

> [!NOTE]
> If this command returns an error saying that the CLI **cannot find user or service principal in graph database**:
>
> Assign the role using the user's *Object ID* instead. This may happen for users on personal [Microsoft accounts (MSAs)](https://account.microsoft.com/account). 
>
> Use the [Azure portal page of Azure Active Directory users](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/AllUsers) to select the user account and open its details. Copy the user's *ObjectID*:
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/includes/user-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the user page in Azure portal highlighting the GUID in the 'Object ID' field." lightbox="media/includes/user-id.png":::
>
> Then, repeat the role assignment list command using the user's *Object ID* for the `assignee` parameter above.

### Verify success

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-setup-verify-role-assignment.md](../../includes/digital-twins-setup-verify-role-assignment.md)]

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go, and have assigned permissions to manage it.

## Next steps

Test out individual REST API calls on your instance using the Azure Digital Twins CLI commands: 
* [az dt reference](/cli/azure/dt)
* [Azure Digital Twins CLI command set](concepts-cli.md)
