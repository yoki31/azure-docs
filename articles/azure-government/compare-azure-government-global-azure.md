# Compare Azure Government and global Azure

Microsoft Azure Government uses same underlying technologies as global Azure, which includes the core components of [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/), [Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/), and [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-saas/). Both Azure and Azure Government have the same comprehensive security controls in place and the same Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to [screened US persons](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#screening). These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations.

## Export control implications

You are responsible for designing and deploying your applications to meet [US export control requirements](./documentation-government-overview-itar.md) such as the requirements prescribed in the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810. In doing so, you should not include sensitive or restricted information in Azure resource names, as explained in [Considerations for naming Azure resources](./documentation-government-concept-naming-resources.md).

## Guidance for developers

Azure Government services operate the same way as the corresponding services in global Azure, which is why most of the existing online Azure documentation applies equally well to Azure Government. However, there are some key differences that developers working on applications hosted in Azure Government must be aware of. For more information, see [Guidance for developers](./documentation-government-developer-guide.md). As a developer, you must know how to connect to Azure Government and once you connect you will mostly have the same experience as in global Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see [**Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module**](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). For Az module installation instructions, see [**Install the Azure Az PowerShell module**](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

You can use AzureCLI or PowerShell to obtain Azure Government endpoints for services you provisioned:

- Use **Azure CLI** to run the [az cloud show](/cli/azure/cloud#az_cloud_show) command and provide `AzureUSGovernment` as the name of the target cloud environment. For example,

  ```azurecli
  az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernment
  ```

  should get you different endpoints for Azure Government.

- Use a **PowerShell** cmdlet such as [Get-AzureEnvironment](/powershell/module/servicemanagement/azure.service/get-azureenvironment) to get endpoints and metadata for an instance of Azure service. For example,

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureEnvironment -Name AzureUSGovernment
  ```

  should get you properties for Azure Government. This cmdlet gets environments from your subscription data file.

Table below lists API endpoints in Azure vs. Azure Government for accessing and managing some of the more common services. If you provisioned a service that isn't listed in the table below, see the Azure CLI and PowerShell examples above for suggestions on how to obtain the corresponding Azure Government endpoint.

  - No. The portals for Azure and Azure Government are separate and do not share information.

#### [Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md)

Application Insights (part of Azure Monitor) enables the same features in both Azure and Azure Government. This section describes the supplemental configuration that is required to use Application Insights in Azure Government.

**Visual Studio** - In Azure Government, you can enable monitoring on your ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, and Node.js based applications running on Azure App Service. For more information, see [Application monitoring for Azure App Service overview](../azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps.md). In Visual Studio, go to Tools|Options|Accounts|Registered Azure Clouds|Add New Azure Cloud and select Azure US Government as the Discovery endpoint. After that, adding an account in File|Account Settings will prompt you for which cloud you want to add from.

**SDK endpoint modifications** - In order to send data from Application Insights to an Azure Government region, you will need to modify the default endpoint addresses that are used by the Application Insights SDKs. Each SDK requires slightly different modifications, as described in [Application Insights overriding default endpoints](../azure-monitor/app/custom-endpoints.md).

**Firewall exceptions** - Application Insights uses several IP addresses. You might need to know these addresses if the app that you are monitoring is hosted behind a firewall. For more information, see [IP addresses used by Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/app/ip-addresses.md) from where you can download Azure Government IP addresses.

>[!NOTE]
>Although these addresses are static, it's possible that we will need to change them from time to time. All Application Insights traffic represents outbound traffic except for availability monitoring and webhooks, which require inbound firewall rules.

You need to open some **outgoing ports** in your server's firewall to allow the Application Insights SDK and/or Status Monitor to send data to the portal:

|Purpose|URL|IP address|Ports|
|-------|---|----------|-----|
|Telemetry|dc.applicationinsights.us|23.97.4.113|443|
