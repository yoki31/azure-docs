# Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-tenant access settings are preview features of Azure Active Directory. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Use External Identities cross-tenant access settings to manage how you collaborate with other Azure AD organizations through B2B collaboration. These settings determine both the level of *inbound* access users in external Azure AD organizations have to your resources, as well as the level of *outbound* access your users have to external organizations. They also let you trust multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device claims ([compliant claims and hybrid Azure AD joined claims](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device.md)) from other Azure AD organizations. For details and planning considerations, see [Cross-tenant access in Azure AD External Identities](cross-tenant-access-overview.md).

## Before you begin

  > [!CAUTION]
  > Changing the default inbound or outbound settings to **Block access** could block existing business-critical access to apps in your organization or partner organizations. Be sure to use the tools described in [Cross-tenant access in Azure AD External Identities](cross-tenant-access-overview.md) and consult with your business stakeholders to identify the required access.

- Review the [Important considerations](cross-tenant-access-overview.md#important-considerations) section in the [cross-tenant access overview](cross-tenant-access-overview.md) before configuring your cross-tenant access settings.
- Use the tools and follow the recommendations in [Identify inbound and outbound sign-ins](cross-tenant-access-overview.md#identify-inbound-and-outbound-sign-ins) to understand which external Azure AD organizations and resources users are currently accessing.
- Decide on the default level of access you want to apply to all external Azure AD organizations.
- Identify any Azure AD organizations that will need customized settings so you can configure **Organizational settings** for them.
- If you want to apply access settings to specific users, groups, or applications in an external organization, you'll need to contact the organization for information before configuring your settings. Obtain their user object IDs, group object IDs, or application IDs (*client app IDs* or *resource app IDs*) so you can target your settings correctly.

## Configure default settings

 Default cross-tenant access settings apply to all external tenants for which you haven't created organization-specific customized settings. If you want to modify the Azure AD-provided default settings, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator or Security administrator account. Then open the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select **External Identities**, and then select **Cross-tenant access settings (Preview)**.
1. Select the **Default settings** tab and review the summary page.

1. To change the settings, select the **Edit inbound defaults** link or the **Edit outbound defaults** link.

      ![Screenshot showing edit buttons for Default settings](media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration/cross-tenant-defaults-edit.png)


1. Modify the default settings by following the detailed steps in these sections:

   - [Modify inbound access settings](#modify-inbound-access-settings)
   - [Modify outbound access settings](#modify-outbound-access-settings)

## Add an organization

Follow these steps to configure customized settings for specific organizations.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator or Security administrator account. Then open the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select **External Identities**, and then select **Cross-tenant access settings (preview)**.
1. Select **Organizational settings**.
1. Select **Add organization**.
1. On the **Add organization** pane, type the full domain name (or tenant ID) for the organization.

   ![Screenshot showing adding an organization](media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration/cross-tenant-add-organization.png)

1. Select the organization in the search results, and then select **Add**.
1. The organization appears in the **Organizational settings** list. At this point, all access settings for this organization are inherited from your default settings. To change the settings for this organization, select the **Inherited from default** link under the **Inbound access** or **Outbound access** column.

   ![Screenshot showing an organization added with default settings](media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration/org-specific-settings-inherited.png)

   - [Modify inbound access settings](#modify-inbound-access-settings)
   - [Modify outbound access settings](#modify-outbound-access-settings)

## Modify inbound access settings

With inbound settings, you select which external users and groups will be able to access the internal applications you choose. Whether you're configuring default settings or organization-specific settings, the steps for changing inbound cross-tenant access settings are the same. As described in this section, you'll navigate to either the **Default** tab or an organization on the **Organizational settings** tab, and then make your changes.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator or Security administrator account. Then open the **Azure Active Directory** service.

1. Select **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings (preview)**.

1. Navigate to the settings you want to modify:
   - **Default settings**: To modify default inbound settings, select the **Default settings** tab, and then under **Inbound access settings**, select **Edit inbound defaults**.
   - **Organizational settings**: To modify settings for a specific organization, select the **Organizational settings** tab, find the organization in the list (or [add one](#add-an-organization)), and then select the link in the **Inbound access** column.

1. Follow the detailed steps for the inbound settings you want to change:

   - [To change inbound B2B collaboration settings](#to-change-inbound-b2b-collaboration-settings)
   - [To change inbound trust settings for accepting MFA and device claims](#to-change-inbound-trust-settings-for-mfa-and-device-claims)
