# Configure the admin consent workflow

In this article, you'll learn how to configure the admin consent workflow to enable users to request access to applications that require admin consent. You enable the ability to make requests by using an admin consent workflow. For more information on consenting to applications, see [Azure Active Directory consent framework](../develop/consent-framework.md).

The admin consent workflow gives admins a secure way to grant access to applications that require admin approval. When a user tries to access an application but is unable to provide consent, they can send a request for admin approval. The request is sent via email to admins who have been designated as reviewers. A reviewer takes action on the request, and the user is notified of the action.

To approve requests, a reviewer must be a global administrator, cloud application administrator, or application administrator. The reviewer must already have one of these admin roles assigned; simply designating them as a reviewer doesn't elevate their privileges.

## Prerequisites

To configure the admin consent workflow, you need:

- An Azure account. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- One of the following roles: Global Administrator or owner of the service principal.

## Enable the admin consent workflow

To enable the admin consent workflow and choose reviewers:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)  with one of the roles listed in the prerequisites.
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Select **Enterprise applications**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **User settings**.
Under **Admin consent requests**,  select **Yes** for **Users can request admin consent to apps they are unable to consent to** .

1. Configure the following settings:

   - **Select users to review admin consent requests** - Select reviewers for this workflow from a set of users that have the global administrator, cloud application administrator, or application administrator roles. You can also add groups and roles that can configure an admin consent workflow. You must designate at least one reviewer before the workflow can be enabled.
   - **Selected users will receive email notifications for requests** - Enable or disable email notifications to the reviewers when a request is made.  
   - **Selected users will receive request expiration reminders** - Enable or disable reminder email notifications to the reviewers when a request is about to expire.  
   - **Consent request expires after (days)** - Specify how long requests stay valid.
1. Select **Save**. It can take up to an hour for the feature to become enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add or remove reviewers for this workflow by modifying the **Select admin consent requests reviewers** list. Note that a current limitation of this feature is that reviewers can retain the ability to review requests that were made while they were designated as a reviewer.

## Email notifications

If configured, all reviewers will receive email notifications when:

- A new request has been created
- A request has expired
- A request is nearing the expiration date  

Requestors will receive email notifications when:

- They submit a new request for access
- Their request has expired
- Their request has been denied or blocked
- Their request has been approved
