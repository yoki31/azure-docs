# Administrative units in Azure Active Directory

This article describes administrative units in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). An administrative unit is an Azure AD resource that can be a container for other Azure AD resources. An administrative unit can contain only users and groups.

Administrative units restrict permissions in a role to any portion of your organization that you define. You could, for example, use administrative units to delegate the [Helpdesk Administrator](permissions-reference.md#helpdesk-administrator) role to regional support specialists, so they can manage users only in the region that they support.

## Deployment scenario

It can be useful to restrict administrative scope by using administrative units in organizations that are made up of independent divisions of any kind. Consider the example of a large university that's made up of many autonomous schools (School of Business, School of Engineering, and so on). Each school has a team of IT admins who control access, manage users, and set policies for their school.

A central administrator could:

- Create an administrative unit for the School of Business.
- Populate the administrative unit with only students and staff within the School of Business.
- Create a role with administrative permissions over only Azure AD users in the School of Business administrative unit.
- Add the business school IT team to the role, along with its scope.

Administrative units apply scope only to management permissions. They don't prevent members or administrators from using their [default user permissions](../fundamentals/users-default-permissions.md) to browse other users, groups, or resources outside the administrative unit. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, users outside a scoped admin's administrative units are filtered out. But you can browse other users in the Azure portal, PowerShell, and other Microsoft services.

## License requirements

Using administrative units requires an Azure AD Premium P1 license for each administrative unit administrator, and Azure AD Free licenses for administrative unit members. To find the right license for your requirements, seeÂ [Comparing generally available features of the Free and Premium editions](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

## Manage administrative units

You can manage administrative units by using the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets and scripts, or Microsoft Graph. For more information, see:

- [Create or delete administrative units](admin-units-manage.md)
- [Add users or groups to an administrative unit](admin-units-members-add.md)
- [Assign Azure AD roles with administrative unit scope](admin-units-assign-roles.md)
- [Work with administrative units](/powershell/azure/active-directory/working-with-administrative-units): Covers how to work with administrative units by using PowerShell.
- [Administrative unit Graph support](/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit): Provides detailed documentation on Microsoft Graph for administrative units.

### Plan your administrative units

You can use administrative units to logically group Azure AD resources. An organization whose IT department is scattered globally might create administrative units that define relevant geographical boundaries. In another scenario, where a global organization has suborganizations that are semi-autonomous in their operations, administrative units could represent the suborganizations.

The criteria on which administrative units are created are guided by the unique requirements of an organization. Administrative units are a common way to define structure across Microsoft 365 services. We recommend that you prepare your administrative units with their use across Microsoft 365 services in mind. You can get maximum value out of administrative units when you can associate common resources across Microsoft 365 under an administrative unit.

You can expect the creation of administrative units in the organization to go through the following stages:

1. **Initial adoption**: Your organization will start creating administrative units based on initial criteria, and the number of administrative units will increase as the criteria are refined.
1. **Pruning**: After the criteria are defined, administrative units that are no longer required will be deleted.
1. **Stabilization**: Your organizational structure is defined, and the number of administrative units isn't going to change significantly in the short term.

## Currently supported scenarios

As a Global Administrator or a Privileged Role Administrator, you can use the Azure portal to:

- Create administrative units
- Add users and groups members of administrative units
- Assign IT staff to administrative unit-scoped administrator roles.

Administrative unit-scoped admins can use the Microsoft 365 admin center for basic management of users in their administrative units. A group administrator with administrative unit scope can manage groups by using PowerShell, Microsoft Graph, and the Microsoft 365 admin centers.

>[!Note]
>Only the features described in this section are available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. No organization-level features are available for an Azure AD role with administrative unit scope.

The following sections describe current support for administrative unit scenarios.

### Administrative unit management

| Permissions |   Graph/PowerShell   | Azure portal | Microsoft 365 admin center |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creating and deleting administrative units   |    Supported    |   Supported   |    Not supported |
| Adding and removing administrative unit members individually    |   Supported    |   Supported   |    Not supported |
| Adding and removing administrative unit members in bulk by using CSV files   |    Not supported     |  Supported   |    No plan to support |
| Assigning administrative unit-scoped administrators  |     Supported    |   Supported    |   Not supported |
| Adding and removing administrative unit members dynamically based on attributes | Not supported | Not supported | Not supported

### User management

| Permissions |   Graph/PowerShell   | Azure portal | Microsoft 365 admin center |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Administrative unit-scoped management of user properties, passwords   |    Supported     |  Supported   |   Supported |
| Administrative unit-scoped management of user licenses | Supported | Not Supported | Supported |
| Administrative unit-scoped blocking and unblocking of user sign-ins    |   Supported   |    Supported   |    Supported |
| Administrative unit-scoped management of user multifactor authentication credentials   |    Supported   |   Supported   |   Not supported |

### Group management

| Permissions |   Graph/PowerShell   | Azure portal | Microsoft 365 admin center |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Administrative unit-scoped management of group properties and membership     |  Supported   |    Supported    |  Not supported |
| Administrative unit-scoped management of group licensing   |    Supported  |    Supported   |   Not supported |

> [!NOTE]
> Adding a group to an administrative unit does not grant scoped group administrators the ability to manage properties for individual members of that group. For example, a scoped group administrator can manage group membership, but they can't manage authentication methods of users who are members of the group added to an administrative unit. To manage authentication methods of users who are members of the group that is added to an administrative unit, the individual group members must be directly added as users of the administrative unit, and the group administrator must also be assigned a role that can manage user authentication methods.

## Constraints

Here are some of the constraints for administrative units.

- Administrative units can't be nested.
- Administrative unit-scoped user account administrators can't create or delete users.
- A scoped role assignment doesn't apply to members of groups added to an administrative unit, unless the group members are directly added to the administrative unit. For more information, see [Add members to an administrative unit](admin-units-members-add.md).
- Administrative units are currently not available in [Azure AD Identity Governance](../governance/identity-governance-overview.md).
