# Device identity and desktop virtualization

Administrators commonly deploy virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) platforms hosting Windows operating systems in their organizations. Administrators deploy VDI to:

- Streamline management.
- Reduce costs through consolidation and centralization of resources.
- Deliver end-users mobility and the freedom to access virtual desktops anytime, from anywhere, on any device.

There are two primary types of virtual desktops:

- Persistent
- Non-persistent

Persistent versions use a unique desktop image for each user or a pool of users. These unique desktops can be customized and saved for future use. 

Non-persistent versions use a collection of desktops that users can access on an as needed basis. These non-persistent desktops are reverted to their original state, in Windows current<sup>1</sup> this change happens when a virtual machine goes through a shutdown/restart/OS reset process and in Windows down-level<sup>2</sup> this change happens when a user signs out.

It's important to ensure organizations manage stale devices that are created because frequent device registration without having a proper strategy for device lifecycle management.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to manage stale devices can lead to pressure increase on your tenant quota usage consumption and potential risk of service interruption, if you run out of tenant quota. You should follow the guidance documented below when deploying non persistent VDI environments to avoid this situation.

This article will cover Microsoft's guidance to administrators on support for device identity and VDI. For more information about device identity, see the article [What is a device identity](overview.md).

## Supported scenarios

Before configuring device identities in Azure AD for your VDI environment, familiarize yourself with the supported scenarios. The table below illustrates which provisioning scenarios are supported. Provisioning in this context implies that an administrator can configure device identities at scale without requiring any end-user interaction.

| Device identity type | Identity infrastructure | Windows devices | VDI platform version | Supported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hybrid Azure AD joined | Federated<sup>3</sup> | Windows current and Windows down-level | Persistent | Yes |
|   |   | Windows current | Non-Persistent | Yes<sup>5</sup> |
|   |   | Windows down-level | Non-Persistent | Yes<sup>6</sup> |
|   | Managed<sup>4</sup> | Windows current and Windows down-level | Persistent | Yes |
|   |   | Windows current | Non-Persistent | No |
|   |   | Windows down-level | Non-Persistent | Yes<sup>6</sup> |
| Azure AD joined | Federated | Windows current | Persistent | Limited<sup>7</sup> |
|   |   |   | Non-Persistent | No |
|   | Managed | Windows current | Persistent | Limited<sup>7</sup> |
|   |   |   | Non-Persistent | No |
| Azure AD registered | Federated/Managed | Windows current/Windows down-level | Persistent/Non-Persistent | Not Applicable |

<sup>1</sup> **Windows current** devices represent Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 v1803 or higher, and Windows Server 2019.

<sup>2</sup> **Windows down-level** devices represent Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For support information on Windows 7, see [Support for Windows 7 is ending](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support). For support information on Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Prepare for Windows Server 2008 end of support](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/windows-server-2008).

<sup>3</sup> A **Federated** identity infrastructure environment represents an environment with an identity provider such as AD FS or other third-party IDP.

<sup>4</sup> A **Managed** identity infrastructure environment represents an environment with Azure AD as the identity provider deployed with either [password hash sync (PHS)](../hybrid/whatis-phs.md) or [pass-through authentication (PTA)](../hybrid/how-to-connect-pta.md) with [seamless single sign-on](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sso.md).

<sup>5</sup> **Non-Persistence support for Windows current** requires other consideration as documented below in guidance section. This scenario requires Windows 10 1803, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server (Semi-annual channel) starting version 1803

<sup>6</sup> **Non-Persistence support for Windows down-level** requires other consideration as documented below in guidance section.

<sup>7</sup> **Azure AD join support** is only available with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365

## Microsoftâ€™s guidance

Administrators should reference the following articles, based on their identity infrastructure, to learn how to configure hybrid Azure AD join.

- [Configure hybrid Azure Active Directory join for federated environment](hybrid-azuread-join-federated-domains.md)
- [Configure hybrid Azure Active Directory join for managed environment](hybrid-azuread-join-managed-domains.md)

### Non-persistent VDI

When deploying non-persistent VDI, Microsoft recommends organizations implement the guidance below. Failure to do so will result in your directory having lots of stale Hybrid Azure AD joined devices that were registered from your non-persistent VDI platform resulting in increased pressure on your tenant quota and risk of service interruption because of running out of tenant quota.

- If you're relying on the System Preparation Tool (sysprep.exe) and if you're using a pre-Windows 10 1809 image for installation, make sure that image isn't from a device that is already registered with Azure AD as hybrid Azure AD joined.
- If you're relying on a Virtual Machine (VM) snapshot to create more VMs, make sure that snapshot isn't from a VM that is already registered with Azure AD as Hybrid Azure AD join.
- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) supports instant join for non-persistent VDI and Hybrid Azure AD Join.
- Create and use a prefix for the display name (for example, NPVDI-) of the computer that indicates the desktop as non-persistent VDI-based.
- For Windows down-level:
   - Implement **autoworkplacejoin /leave** command as part of logoff script. This command should be triggered in the context of the user, and should be executed before the user has logged off completely and network connectivity exists.
- For Windows current in a Federated environment (for example, AD FS):
   - Implement **dsregcmd /join** as part of VM boot sequence/order and before user signs in.
   - **DO NOT** execute dsregcmd /leave as part of VM shutdown/restart process.
- Define and implement process for [managing stale devices](manage-stale-devices.md).
   - Once you have a strategy to identify your non-persistent Hybrid Azure AD joined devices (such as using computer display name prefix), you should be more aggressive on the cleanup of these devices to ensure your directory doesn't get consumed with lots of stale devices.
   - For non-persistent VDI deployments on Windows current and down-level, you should delete devices that have **ApproximateLastLogonTimestamp** of older than 15 days.

> [!NOTE]
> When using non-persistent VDI, if you want to prevent adding a work or school account ensure the following registry key is set:  
> `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WorkplaceJoin: "BlockAADWorkplaceJoin"=dword:00000001`    
>
> Ensure you're running Windows 10, version 1803 or higher.  
>
> Roaming any data under the path `%localappdata%` is not supported. If you choose to move content under `%localappdata%`, make sure that the content of the following folders and registry keys **never** leaves the device under any condition. For example: Profile migration tools must skip the following folders and keys:
>
> * `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy`
> * `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy`
> * `%localappdata%\Packages\<any app package>\AC\TokenBroker`
> * `%localappdata%\Microsoft\TokenBroker`
> * `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IdentityCRL`
> * `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AAD`
> * `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WorkplaceJoin`
>
> Roaming of the work account's device certificate is not supported. The certificate, issued by "MS-Organization-Access", is stored in the Personal (MY) certificate store of the current user and on the local machine.


### Persistent VDI

When deploying persistent VDI, Microsoft recommends that IT administrators implement the guidance below. Failure to do so will result in deployment and authentication issues. 

- If you're relying on the System Preparation Tool (sysprep.exe) and if you're using a pre-Windows 10 1809 image for installation, make sure that image isn't from a device that is already registered with Azure AD as hybrid Azure AD joined.
- If you're relying on a Virtual Machine (VM) snapshot to create more VMs, make sure that snapshot isn't from a VM that is already registered with Azure AD as Hybrid Azure AD join.

We recommend you to implement process for [managing stale devices](manage-stale-devices.md). This process will ensure your directory doesn't get consumed with lots of stale devices if you periodically reset your VMs.
