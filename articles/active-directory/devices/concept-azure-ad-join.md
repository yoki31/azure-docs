# Azure AD joined devices

Any organization can deploy Azure AD joined devices no matter the size or industry. Azure AD join works even in hybrid environments, enabling access to both cloud and on-premises apps and resources.

| Azure AD Join | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Joined only to Azure AD requiring organizational account to sign in to the device |
| **Primary audience** | Suitable for both cloud-only and hybrid organizations. |
|   | Applicable to all users in an organization |
| **Device ownership** | Organization |
| **Operating Systems** | All Windows 10 devices except Windows 10 Home |
|   | [Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machines running in Azure](howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows.md) (Server core isn't supported) |
| **Provisioning** | Self-service: Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE) or Settings |
|   | Bulk enrollment |
|   | Windows Autopilot |
| **Device sign in options** | Organizational accounts using: |
|   | Password |
|   | Windows Hello for Business |
|   | FIDO2.0 security keys (preview) |
| **Device management** | Mobile Device Management (example: Microsoft Intune) |
|   | [Configuration Manager standalone or co-management with Microsoft Intune](/mem/configmgr/comanage/overview) |
| **Key capabilities** | SSO to both cloud and on-premises resources |
|   | Conditional Access through MDM enrollment and MDM compliance evaluation |
|   | [Self-service Password Reset and Windows Hello PIN reset on lock screen](../authentication/howto-sspr-windows.md) |

Azure AD joined devices are signed in to using an organizational Azure AD account. Access to resources in the organization can be further limited based on that Azure AD account and [Conditional Access policies](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device.md) applied to the device identity.

Administrators can secure and further control Azure AD joined devices using Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools like Microsoft Intune or in co-management scenarios using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. These tools provide a means to enforce organization-required configurations like requiring storage to be encrypted, password complexity, software installations, and software updates. Administrators can make organization applications available to Azure AD joined devices using Configuration Manager to [Manage apps from the Microsoft Store for Business and Education](/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/manage-apps-from-the-windows-store-for-business).

Azure AD join can be accomplished using self-service options like the Out of Box Experience (OOBE), bulk enrollment, or [Windows Autopilot](/intune/enrollment-autopilot).

Azure AD joined devices can still maintain single sign-on access to on-premises resources when they are on the organization's network. Devices that are Azure AD joined can still authenticate to on-premises servers like file, print, and other applications.

## Scenarios

While Azure AD join can be used in a variety of scenarios like:

- You want to transition to cloud-based infrastructure using Azure AD and MDM like Intune.
- You canâ€™t use an on-premises domain join, for example, if you need to get mobile devices such as tablets and phones under control.
- Your users primarily need to access Microsoft 365 or other SaaS apps integrated with Azure AD.
- You want to manage a group of users in Azure AD instead of in Active Directory. This scenario can apply, for example, to seasonal workers, contractors, or students.
- You want to provide joining capabilities to workers who work from home or are in remote branch offices with limited on-premises infrastructure.

You can configure Azure AD join for all Windows 10 devices except for Windows 10 Home.

The goal of Azure AD joined devices is to simplify:

- Windows deployments of work-owned devices
- Access to organizational apps and resources from any Windows device
- Cloud-based management of work-owned devices
- Users to sign in to their devices with their Azure AD or synced Active Directory work or school accounts.

Azure AD Join can be deployed by using any of the following methods:

- [Windows Autopilot](/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-10-autopilot)
- [Bulk deployment](/intune/windows-bulk-enroll)
- [Self-service experience](azuread-joined-devices-frx.md)
