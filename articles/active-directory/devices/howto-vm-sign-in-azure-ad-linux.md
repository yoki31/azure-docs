# Login to a Linux virtual machine in Azure with Azure Active Directory using openSSH certificate-based authentication

To improve the security of Linux virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, you can integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. You can now use Azure AD as a core authentication platform and a certificate authority to SSH into a Linux VM using Azure AD and openSSH certificate-based authentication. This functionality allows organizations to manage access to VMs with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and Conditional Access policies. This article shows you how to create and configure a Linux VM and login with Azure AD using openSSH certificate-based authentication.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capability is now generally available! [The previous version that made use of device code flow was deprecated August 15, 2021](../../virtual-machines/linux/login-using-aad.md). To migrate from the old version to this version, see the section, [Migration from previous preview](#migration-from-previous-preview).

There are many security benefits of using Azure AD with openSSH certificate-based authentication to log in to Linux VMs in Azure, including:

- Use your Azure AD credentials to log in to Azure Linux VMs.
- Get SSH key based authentication without needing to distribute SSH keys to users or provision SSH public keys on any Azure Linux VMs you deploy. This experience is much simpler than having to worry about sprawl of stale SSH public keys that could cause unauthorized access.
- Reduce reliance on local administrator accounts, credential theft, and weak credentials.
- Password complexity and password lifetime policies configured for Azure AD help secure Linux VMs as well.
- With Azure role-based access control, specify who can login to a VM as a regular user or with administrator privileges. When users join or leave your team, you can update the Azure RBAC policy for the VM to grant access as appropriate. When employees leave your organization and their user account is disabled or removed from Azure AD, they no longer have access to your resources.
- With Conditional Access, configure policies to require multi-factor authentication and or require client device you’re using to SSH be a managed device (for example: compliant device or hybrid Azure AD joined) before you can SSH to Linux VMs. 
- Use Azure deploy and audit policies to require Azure AD login for Linux VMs and flag non-approved local accounts.
- Login to Linux VMs with Azure Active Directory also works for customers that use Federation Services.

## Supported Linux distributions and Azure regions

The following Linux distributions are currently supported during the preview of this feature when deployed in a supported region:

| Distribution | Version |
| --- | --- |
| CentOS | CentOS 7, CentOS 8 |
| Debian | Debian 9, Debian 10 |
| openSUSE | openSUSE Leap 42.3, openSUSE Leap 15.1+ |
| RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) | RHEL 7.4 to RHEL 7.10, RHEL 8.3+ |
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) | SLES 12, SLES 15.1+ |
| Ubuntu Server | Ubuntu Server 16.04 to Ubuntu Server 20.04 |

The following Azure regions are currently supported for this feature:

- Azure Global
- Azure Government
- Azure China 21Vianet
 
It's not supported to use this extension on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. For more information, see [Support policies for AKS](../../aks/support-policies.md).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you must be running the Azure CLI version 2.22.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Requirements for login with Azure AD using openSSH certificate-based authentication

To enable Azure AD login using SSH certificate-based authentication for Linux VMs in Azure, ensure the following network, virtual machine, and client (ssh client) requirements are met.

### Network

VM network configuration must permit outbound access to the following endpoints over TCP port 443:

For Azure Global

- `https://packages.microsoft.com` – For package installation and upgrades.
- `http://169.254.169.254` – Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.
- `https://login.microsoftonline.com` – For PAM (pluggable authentication modules) based authentication flows.
- `https://pas.windows.net` – For Azure RBAC flows.

For Azure Government

- `https://packages.microsoft.com` – For package installation and upgrades.
- `http://169.254.169.254` – Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.
- `https://login.microsoftonline.us` – For PAM (pluggable authentication modules) based authentication flows.
- `https://pasff.usgovcloudapi.net` – For Azure RBAC flows.

For Azure China 21Vianet

- `https://packages.microsoft.com` – For package installation and upgrades.
- `http://169.254.169.254` – Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.
- `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn` – For PAM (pluggable authentication modules) based authentication flows.
- `https://pas.chinacloudapi.cn` – For Azure RBAC flows.

### Virtual machine

Ensure your VM is configured with the following functionality:

- System assigned managed identity. This option gets automatically selected when you use Azure portal to create VM and select Azure AD login option. You can also enable system-assigned managed identity on a new or an existing VM using the Azure CLI.
- `aadsshlogin` and `aadsshlogin-selinux` (as appropriate). These packages get installed with the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension. The extension is installed when you use Azure portal to create VM and enable Azure AD login (Management tab) or via the Azure CLI.

### Client

Ensure your client meets the following requirements:

- SSH client must support OpenSSH based certificates for authentication. You can use Az CLI (2.21.1 or higher) with OpenSSH (included in Windows 10 version 1803 or higher) or Azure Cloud Shell to meet this requirement. 
- SSH extension for Az CLI. You can install this using `az extension add --name ssh`. You don’t need to install this extension when using Azure Cloud Shell as it comes pre-installed.
- If you’re using any other SSH client other than Az CLI or Azure Cloud Shell that supports OpenSSH certificates, you’ll still need to use Az CLI with SSH extension to retrieve ephemeral SSH cert and optionally a config file and then use the config file with your SSH client.
- TCP connectivity from the client to either the public or private IP of the VM (ProxyCommand or SSH forwarding to a machine with connectivity also works).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SSH clients based on PuTTy do not support openSSH certificates and cannot be used to login with Azure AD openSSH certificate-based authentication.

## Enabling Azure AD login in for Linux VM in Azure

To use Azure AD login in for Linux VM in Azure, you need to first enable Azure AD login option for your Linux VM, configure Azure role assignments for users who are authorized to login in to the VM and then use SSH client that supports OpensSSH such as Az CLI or Az Cloud Shell to SSH to your Linux VM. There are multiple ways you can enable Azure AD login for your Linux VM, as an example you can use:

- Azure portal experience when creating a Linux VM
- Azure Cloud Shell experience when creating a Windows VM or for an existing Linux VM

### Using Azure portal create VM experience to enable Azure AD login

You can enable Azure AD login for any of the [supported Linux distributions mentioned](#supported-linux-distributions-and-azure-regions) using the Azure portal.

As an example, to create an Ubuntu Server 18.04 Long Term Support (LTS) VM in Azure with Azure AD logon:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, with an account that has access to create VMs, and select **+ Create a resource**.
1. Click on **Create** under **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS** in the **Popular** view.
1. On the **Management** tab, 
   1. Check the box to enable **Login with Azure Active Directory (Preview)**.
   1. Ensure **System assigned managed identity** is checked.
1. Go through the rest of the experience of creating a virtual machine. During this preview, you’ll have to create an administrator account with username and password or SSH public key.
 
### Using the Azure Cloud Shell experience to enable Azure AD login

Azure Cloud Shell is a free, interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. Common Azure tools are preinstalled and configured in Cloud Shell for you to use with your account. Just select the Copy button to copy the code, paste it in Cloud Shell, and then press Enter to run it. There are a few ways to open Cloud Shell:

- Select Try It in the upper-right corner of a code block.
- Open Cloud Shell in your browser.
- Select the Cloud Shell button on the menu in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you’re running the Azure CLI version 2.22.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see the article Install Azure CLI.

1. Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create).
1. Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_create&preserve-view=true) using a supported distribution in a supported region.
1. Install the Azure AD login VM extension with [az vm extension set](/cli/azure/vm/extension#az_vm_extension_set).

The following example deploys a VM and then installs the extension to enable Azure AD login for Linux VM. VM extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure virtual machines.

The example can be customized to support your testing requirements as needed.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name AzureADLinuxVM --location southcentralus

az vm create \
    --resource-group AzureADLinuxVM \
    --name myVM \	
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --assign-identity \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys

az vm extension set \
    --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory \
    --name AADSSHLoginForLinux \
    --resource-group AzureADLinuxVM \
    --vm-name myVM
```

It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources.

The AADSSHLoginForLinux extension can be installed on an existing (supported distribution) Linux VM with a running VM agent to enable Azure AD authentication. If deploying this extension to a previously created VM, the VM must have at least 1 GB of memory allocated or the install will fail.

The provisioningState of Succeeded is shown once the extension is successfully installed on the VM. The VM must have a running [VM agent](../../virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux.md) to install the extension.

## Configure role assignments for the VM

Now that you’ve created the VM, you need to configure Azure RBAC policy to determine who can log in to the VM. Two Azure roles are used to authorize VM login:

- **Virtual Machine Administrator Login**: Users with this role assigned can log in to an Azure virtual machine with administrator privileges.
- **Virtual Machine User Login**: Users with this role assigned can log in to an Azure virtual machine with regular user privileges.
 
To log in to a VM over SSH, you must have the Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login role. An Azure user with the Owner or Contributor roles assigned for a VM don’t automatically have privileges to Azure AD login to the VM over SSH. This separation is to provide audited separation between the set of people who control virtual machines versus the set of people who can access virtual machines. 

There are multiple ways you can configure role assignments for VM, as an example you can use:

- Azure AD Portal experience
- Azure Cloud Shell experience

> [!Note]
> The Virtual Machine Administrator Login and Virtual Machine User Login roles use dataActions and can be assigned at the management group, subscription, resource group, or resource scope. It is recommended that the roles be assigned at the management group, subscription or resource level and not at the individual VM level to avoid risk of running out of [Azure role assignments limit](../../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#azure-role-assignments-limit) per subscription.

### Using Azure AD Portal experience

To configure role assignments for your Azure AD enabled Linux VMs:

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment** to open the Add role assignment page.

1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Role | **Virtual Machine Administrator Login** or **Virtual Machine User Login** |
    | Assign access to | User, group, service principal, or managed identity |

    ![Add role assignment page in Azure portal.](../../../includes/role-based-access-control/media/add-role-assignment-page.png)

After a few moments, the security principal is assigned the role at the selected scope.
 
### Using the Azure Cloud Shell experience

The following example uses [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az_role_assignment_create) to assign the Virtual Machine Administrator Login role to the VM for your current Azure user. The username of your current Azure account is obtained with [az account show](/cli/azure/account#az_account_show), and the scope is set to the VM created in a previous step with [az vm show](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_show). The scope could also be assigned at a resource group or subscription level, normal Azure RBAC inheritance permissions apply.

```azurecli-interactive
username=$(az account show --query user.name --output tsv)
vm=$(az vm show --resource-group AzureADLinuxVM --name myVM --query id -o tsv)

az role assignment create \
    --role "Virtual Machine Administrator Login" \
    --assignee $username \
    --scope $vm
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your Azure AD domain and logon username domain do not match, you must specify the object ID of your user account with the `--assignee-object-id`, not just the username for `--assignee`. You can obtain the object ID for your user account with [az ad user list](/cli/azure/ad/user#az_ad_user_list).

For more information on how to use Azure RBAC to manage access to your Azure subscription resources, see the article [Steps to assign an Azure role](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md).

## Install SSH extension for Az CLI

If you’re using Azure Cloud Shell, then no other setup is needed as both the minimum required version of Az CLI and SSH extension for Az CLI are already included in the Cloud Shell environment.

Run the following command to add SSH extension for Az CLI

```azurecli
az extension add --name ssh
```

The minimum version required for the extension is 0.1.4. Check the installed SSH extension version with the following command.

```azurecli
az extension show --name ssh
```

## Using Conditional Access

You can enforce Conditional Access policies such as require multi-factor authentication, require compliant or hybrid Azure AD joined device for the device running SSH client, and checking for risk before authorizing access to Linux VMs in Azure that are enabled with Azure AD login in. The application that appears in Conditional Access policy is called "Azure Linux VM Sign-In".

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policy enforcement requiring device compliance or Hybrid Azure AD join on the client device running SSH client only works with Az CLI running on Windows and macOS. It is not supported when using Az CLI on Linux or Azure Cloud Shell.

## Login using Azure AD user account to SSH into the Linux VM

### Using Az CLI

First do az login and then az ssh vm.

```azurecli
az login 
```

This command will launch a browser window and a user can sign in using their Azure AD account. 

The following example automatically resolves the appropriate IP address for the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh vm -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVM
```

If prompted, enter your Azure AD login credentials at the login page, perform an MFA, and/or satisfy device checks. You’ll only be prompted if your az CLI session doesn’t already meet any required Conditional Access criteria. Close the browser window, return to the SSH prompt, and you’ll be automatically connected to the VM.

You’re now signed in to the Azure Linux virtual machine with the role permissions as assigned, such as VM User or VM Administrator. If your user account is assigned the Virtual Machine Administrator Login role, you can use sudo to run commands that require root privileges.

### Using Az Cloud Shell

You can use Az Cloud Shell to connect to VMs without needing to install anything locally to your client machine. Start Cloud Shell by clicking the shell icon in the upper right corner of the Azure portal.
 
Az Cloud Shell will automatically connect to a session in the context of the signed in user. During the Azure AD Login for Linux Preview, **you must run az login again and go through an interactive sign in flow**.

```azurecli
az login
```

Then you can use the normal `az ssh vm` commands to connect using name and resource group or IP address of the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh vm -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVM
```

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policy enforcement requiring device compliance or Hybrid Azure AD join is not supported when using Az Cloud Shell.

### Login using Azure AD service principal to SSH into the Linux VM

Azure CLI supports authenticating with a service principal instead of a user account. Since service principals are account not tied to any particular user, customers can use them to SSH to a VM to support any automation scenarios they may have. The service principal must have VM Administrator or VM User rights assigned. Assign permissions at the subscription or resource group level. 

The following example will assign VM Administrator rights to the service principal at the resource group level. Replace the service principal object ID, subscription ID, and resource group name fields.

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --role "Virtual Machine Administrator Login" \
    --assignee-object-id <service-principal-objectid> \
    --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \
    --scope “/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup-name>"
```

Use the following example to authenticate to Azure CLI using the service principal. To learn more about signing in using a service principal, see the article [Sign in to Azure CLI with a service principal](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-in-with-a-service-principal).

```azurecli
az login --service-principal -u <sp-app-id> -p <password-or-cert> --tenant <tenant-id>
```

Once authentication with a service principal is complete, use the normal Az CLI SSH commands to connect to the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh vm -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVM
```

### Exporting SSH Configuration for use with SSH clients that support OpenSSH

Login to Azure Linux VMs with Azure AD supports exporting the OpenSSH certificate and configuration, allowing you to use any SSH clients that support OpenSSH based certificates to sign in Azure AD. The following example exports the configuration for all IP addresses assigned to the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh config --file ~/.ssh/config -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVM
```

Alternatively, you can export the config by specifying just the IP address. Replace the IP address in the example with the public or private IP address (you must bring your own connectivity for private IPs) for your VM. Type `az ssh config -h` for help on this command.

```azurecli
az ssh config --file ~/.ssh/config --ip 10.11.123.456
```

You can then connect to the VM through normal OpenSSH usage. Connection can be done through any SSH client that uses OpenSSH.

## Sudo and Azure AD login

Once, users assigned the VM Administrator role successfully SSH into a Linux VM, they’ll be able to run sudo with no other interaction or authentication requirement. Users assigned the VM User role won’t be able to run sudo.

## Virtual machine scale set support

Virtual machine scale sets are supported, but the steps are slightly different for enabling and connecting to virtual machine scale set VMs.

1. Create a virtual machine scale set or choose one that already exists. Enable a system assigned managed identity for your virtual machine scale set.

```azurecli
az vmss identity assign --name myVMSS --resource-group AzureADLinuxVM
```

2. Install the Azure AD extension on your virtual machine scale set.

```azurecli
az vmss extension set --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory --name AADSSHLoginForLinux --resource-group AzureADLinuxVM --vmss-name myVMSS
```

Virtual machine scale sets usually don't have public IP addresses. You must have connectivity to them from another machine that can reach their Azure virtual network. This example shows how to use the private IP of a virtual machine scale set VM to connect from a machine in the same virtual network. 

```azurecli
az ssh vm --ip 10.11.123.456
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot automatically determine the virtual machine scale set VM's IP addresses using the `--resource-group` and `--name` switches.

## Migration from previous preview

For customers who are using previous version of Azure AD login for Linux that was based on device code flow, complete the following steps using Azure CLI.

1. Uninstall the AADLoginForLinux extension on the VM.
   
   ```azurecli
   az vm extension delete -g MyResourceGroup --vm-name MyVm -n AADLoginForLinux
   ```
> [!NOTE]
> The extension uninstall can fail if there are any Azure AD users currently logged in on the VM. Make sure all users are logged off first.

1. Enable system-assigned managed identity on your VM.

   ```azurecli
   az vm identity assign -g myResourceGroup -n myVm
   ```

1. Install the AADSSHLoginForLinux extension on the VM.

    ```azurecli
    az vm extension set \
        --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory \
        --name AADSSHLoginForLinux \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --vm-name myVM
    ```

## Using Azure Policy to ensure standards and assess compliance

Use Azure Policy to ensure Azure AD login is enabled for your new and existing Linux virtual machines and assess compliance of your environment at scale on your Azure Policy compliance dashboard. With this capability, you can use many levels of enforcement: you can flag new and existing Linux VMs within your environment that don’t have Azure AD login enabled. You can also use Azure Policy to deploy the Azure AD extension on new Linux VMs that don’t have Azure AD login enabled, as well as remediate existing Linux VMs to the same standard. In addition to these capabilities, you can also use Azure Policy to detect and flag Linux VMs that have non-approved local accounts created on their machines. To learn more, review [Azure Policy](../../governance/policy/overview.md).

## Troubleshoot sign-in issues

Some common errors when you try to SSH with Azure AD credentials include no Azure roles assigned, and repeated prompts to sign in. Use the following sections to correct these issues.

### Couldn’t retrieve token from local cache

You must run az login again and go through an interactive sign in flow. Review the section [Using Az Cloud Shell](#using-az-cloud-shell).

### Access denied: Azure role not assigned

If you see the following error on your SSH prompt, verify that you have configured Azure RBAC policies for the VM that grants the user either the Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login role. If you’re running into issues with Azure role assignments, see the article [Troubleshoot Azure RBAC](../../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#azure-role-assignments-limit).

### Problems deleting the old (AADLoginForLinux) extension

If the uninstall scripts fail, the extension may get stuck in a transitioning state. When this happens, it can leave packages that it’s supposed to uninstall during its removal. In such cases, it’s better to manually uninstall the old packages and then try to run az vm extension delete command.

1.	Log in as a local user with admin privileges.
1.	Make sure there are no logged in Azure AD users. Call `who -u` command to see who is logged in; then `sudo kill <pid>` for all session processes reported by the previous command.
1.	Run `sudo apt remove --purge aadlogin` (Ubuntu/Debian), `sudo yum erase aadlogin` (RHEL or CentOS), or `sudo zypper remove aadlogin` (OpenSuse or SLES).
1.	If the command fails, try the low-level tools with scripts disabled:
   1. For Ubuntu/Deian run `sudo dpkg --purge aadlogin`. If it’s still failing because of the script, delete `/var/lib/dpkg/info/aadlogin.prerm` file and try again.
   1. For everything else run `rpm -e –noscripts aadogin`.
1.	Repeat steps 3-4 for package `aadlogin-selinux`.

### Extension Install Errors

Installation of the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension to existing computers fails with one of the following known error codes:

#### Non-zero exit code: 22

The Status of the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension shows as Transitioning in the portal.

Cause 1: This failure is due to a system-assigned managed identity being required.

Solution 1: Perform these actions:

1. Uninstall the failed extension.
1. Enable a system-assigned managed identity on the Azure VM.
1. Run the extension install command again.

#### Non-zero exit code: 23

The Status of the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension shows as Transitioning in the portal.

Cause 1: This failure is due to the older AADLoginForLinux VM extension is still installed.

Solution 1: Perform these actions:

1. Uninstall the older AADLoginForLinux VM extension from the VM. The Status of the new AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension will change to Provisioning succeeded in the portal.

#### Az ssh vm fails with KeyError: 'access_token'.

Cause 1: An outdated version of the Azure CLI client is being used.

Solution 1: Upgrade the Azure CLI client to version 2.21.0 or higher.

#### SSH Connection closed

After the user has successfully signed in using az login, connection to the VM using `az ssh vm -ip <addres>` or `az ssh vm --name <vm_name> -g <resource_group>` fails with *Connection closed by <ip_address> port 22*.

Cause 1: The user isn’t assigned to the either the Virtual Machine Administrator/User Login Azure RBAC roles within the scope of this VM.

Solution 1: Add the user to the either of the Virtual Machine Administrator/User Login Azure RBAC roles within the scope of this VM.

Cause 2: The user is in a required Azure RBAC role but the system-assigned managed identity has been disabled on the VM.

Solution 2: Perform these actions:

1. Enable the system-assigned managed identity on the VM.
1. Allow several minutes to pass before trying to connect using `az ssh vm --ip <ip_address>`.

### Virtual machine scale set Connection Issues

Virtual machine scale set VM connections may fail if the virtual machine scale set instances are running an old model. Upgrading virtual machine scale set instances to the latest model may resolve issues, especially if an upgrade hasn’t been done since the Azure AD Login extension was installed. Upgrading an instance applies a standard virtual machine scale set configuration to the individual instance.
