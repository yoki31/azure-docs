# Cross-tenant access activity workbook

As an IT administrator, you want insights into how your users are collaborating with other organizations. The cross-tenant access activity workbook helps you understand which external users are accessing resources in your organization, and which organizations’ resources your users are accessing. This workbook combines all your organization’s inbound and outbound collaboration into a single view.

This article provides you with an overview of this workbook.


## Description

![Image showing this workbook is found under the Usage category](./media/workbook-cross-tenant-access-activity/workbook-category.png)

Tenant administrators who are making changes to policies governing cross-tenant access can use this workbook to visualize and review existing access activity patterns before making policy changes. For example, you can identify the apps your users are accessing in external organizations so that you don't inadvertently block critical business processes. Understanding how external users access resources in your tenant (inbound access) and how users in your tenant access resources in external tenants (outbound access) will help ensure you have the right cross-tenant policies in place.

For more information, see the [Azure AD External Identities documentation](../external-identities/index.yml).

## Sections

This workbook has four sections:  

- All inbound and outbound activity by tenant ID

- Sign-in status summary by tenant ID for inbound and outbound collaboration

- Applications accessed for inbound and outbound collaboration by tenant ID

- Individual users for inbound and outbound collaboration by tenant ID
