# Microsoft identity platform ID tokens

The ID token is the core extension that [OpenID Connect](v2-protocols-oidc.md) makes to OAuth 2.0. ID tokens are issued by the authorization server and contain claims that carry information about the user. They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. Information in ID Tokens allows the client to verify that a user is who they claim to be. ID tokens are intended to be understood by third-party applications. ID tokens should not be used for authorization purposes. [Access tokens](access-tokens.md) are used for authorization. The claims provided by ID tokens can be used for UX inside your application, as [keys in a database](#using-claims-to-reliably-identify-a-user-subject-and-object-id), and providing access to the client application.

## Prerequisites

The following article will be beneficial before going through this article:

* [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols](active-directory-v2-protocols.md) on the Microsoft identity platform


## Claims in an ID token

ID tokens are [JSON web tokens (JWT)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). These ID tokens consist of a header, payload, and signature. The header and signature are used to verify the authenticity of the token, while the payload contains the information about the user requested by your client. The v1.0 and v2.0 ID tokens have differences in the information they carry. The version is based on the endpoint from where it was requested. While existing applications likely use the Azure AD endpoint (v1.0), new applications should use the "Microsoft identity platform" endpoint(v2.0).

* v1.0: Azure AD endpoint: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize`
* v2.0: Microsoft identity Platform endpoint: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`

All JWT claims listed below appear in both v1.0 and v2.0 tokens unless stated otherwise.

### Header claims

The table below shows header claims present in ID tokens.

|Claim | Format | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
|`typ` | String - always "JWT" | Indicates that the token is a JWT token.|
|`alg` | String | Indicates the algorithm that was used to sign the token. Example: "RS256" |
| `kid` | String | Specifies the thumbprint for the public key that can be used to validate this token's signature. Emitted in both v1.0 and v2.0 ID tokens. |
| `x5t` | String | Functions the same (in use and value) as `kid`. `x5t` is a legacy claim emitted only in v1.0 ID tokens for compatibility purposes. |

### Payload claims

The table below shows the claims that are in most ID tokens by default (except where noted).  However, your app can use [optional claims](active-directory-optional-claims.md) to request more claims in the ID token. Optional claims can range from the `groups` claim to information about the user's name.

|Claim | Format | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
|`aud` |  String, an App ID GUID | Identifies the intended recipient of the token. In `id_tokens`, the audience is your app's Application ID, assigned to your app in the Azure portal. This value should be validated. The token should be rejected if it fails to match your app's Application ID. |
|`iss` |  String, an issuer URI | Identifies the issuer, or "authorization server" that constructs and returns the token. It also identifies the Azure AD tenant for which the user was authenticated. If the token was issued by the v2.0 endpoint, the URI will end in `/v2.0`.  The GUID that indicates that the user is a consumer user from a Microsoft account is `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`. Your app should use the GUID portion of the claim to restrict the set of tenants that can sign in to the app, if applicable. |
|`iat` |  int, a Unix timestamp | "Issued At" indicates when the authentication for this token occurred.  |
|`idp`|String, usually an STS URI | Records the identity provider that authenticated the subject of the token. This value is identical to the value of the Issuer claim unless the user account not in the same tenant as the issuer - guests, for instance. If the claim isn't present, it means that the value of `iss` can be used instead.  For personal accounts being used in an organizational context (for instance, a personal account invited to an Azure AD tenant), the `idp` claim may be 'live.com' or an STS URI containing the Microsoft account tenant `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`. |
|`nbf` |  int, a Unix timestamp | The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.|
|`exp` |  int, a Unix timestamp | The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT **must not** be accepted for processing.  It's important to note that in certain circumstances, a resource may reject the token before this time. For example, if a change in authentication is required or a token revocation has been detected. |
| `c_hash`| String |The code hash is included in ID tokens only when the ID token is issued with an OAuth 2.0 authorization code. It can be used to validate the authenticity of an authorization code. To understand how to do this validation, see the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridIDToken). |
|`at_hash`| String |The access token hash is included in ID tokens only when the ID token is issued from the `/authorize` endpoint with an OAuth 2.0 access token. It can be used to validate the authenticity of an access token. To understand how to do this validation, see the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridIDToken). This is not returned on ID tokens from the `/token` endpoint. |
|`aio` | Opaque String | An internal claim used by Azure AD to record data for token reuse. Should be ignored.|
|`preferred_username` | String |The primary username that represents the user. It could be an email address, phone number, or a generic username without a specified format. Its value is mutable and might change over time. Since it is mutable, this value must not be used to make authorization decisions. It can be used for username hints, however, and in human-readable UI as a username. The `profile` scope is required in order to receive this claim. Present only in v2.0 tokens.|
|`email` | String | The `email` claim is present by default for guest accounts that have an email address.  Your app can request the email claim for managed users (those from the same tenant as the resource) using the `email` [optional claim](active-directory-optional-claims.md).  On the v2.0 endpoint, your app can also request the `email` OpenID Connect scope - you don't need to request both the optional claim and the scope to get the claim.|
|`name` | String | The `name` claim provides a human-readable value that identifies the subject of the token. The value isn't guaranteed to be unique, it can be changed, and it's designed to be used only for display purposes. The `profile` scope is required to receive this claim. |
|`nonce`| String | The nonce matches the parameter included in the original /authorize request to the IDP. If it does not match, your application should reject the token. |
|`oid` | String, a GUID | The immutable identifier for an object in the Microsoft identity system, in this case, a user account. This ID uniquely identifies the user across applications - two different applications signing in the same user will receive the same value in the `oid` claim. The Microsoft Graph will return this ID as the `id` property for a given user account. Because the `oid` allows multiple apps to correlate users, the `profile` scope is required to receive this claim. Note that if a single user exists in multiple tenants, the user will contain a different object ID in each tenant - they're considered different accounts, even though the user logs into each account with the same credentials. The `oid` claim is a GUID and cannot be reused. |
|`roles`| Array of strings | The set of roles that were assigned to the user who is logging in. |
|`rh` | Opaque String |An internal claim used by Azure to revalidate tokens. Should be ignored. |
|`sub` | String | The principal about which the token asserts information, such as the user of an app. This value is immutable and cannot be reassigned or reused. The subject is a pairwise identifier - it is unique to a particular application ID. If a single user signs into two different apps using two different client IDs, those apps will receive two different values for the subject claim. This may or may not be wanted depending on your architecture and privacy requirements. |
|`tid` | String, a GUID | Represents the tenant that the user is signing in to. For work and school accounts, the GUID is the immutable tenant ID of the organization that the user is signing in to. For sign-ins to the personal Microsoft account tenant (services like Xbox, Teams for Life, or Outlook), the value is `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`. To receive this claim, your app must request the `profile` scope. |
| `unique_name` | String | Only present in v1.0 tokens. Provides a human readable value that identifies the subject of the token. This value is not guaranteed to be unique within a tenant and should be used only for display purposes. |
| `uti` | String | Token identifier claim, equivalent to `jti` in the JWT specification. Unique, per-token identifier that is case-sensitive.|
|`ver` | String, either 1.0 or 2.0 | Indicates the version of the id_token. |
|`hasgroups`|Boolean|If present, always true, denoting the user is in at least one group. Used in place of the groups claim for JWTs in implicit grant flows if the full groups claim would extend the URI fragment beyond the URL length limits (currently 6 or more groups). Indicates that the client should use the Microsoft Graph API to determine the user's groups (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{userID}/getMemberObjects`).|
|`groups:src1`|JSON object | For token requests that are not limited in length (see `hasgroups` above) but still too large for the token, a link to the full groups list for the user will be included. For JWTs as a distributed claim, for SAML as a new claim in place of the `groups` claim. <br><br>**Example JWT Value**: <br> `"groups":"src1"` <br> `"_claim_sources`: `"src1" : { "endpoint" : "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{userID}/getMemberObjects" }`<br><br> For more info, see [Groups overage claim](#groups-overage-claim).|

### Using claims to reliably identify a user (Subject and Object ID)

When identifying a user (say, looking them up in a database, or deciding what permissions they have), it's critical to use information that will remain constant and unique across time. Legacy applications sometimes use fields like the email address, a phone number, or the UPN.  All of these can change over time, and can also be reused over time . For example, when an employee changes their name, or an employee is given an email address that matches that of a previous, no longer present employee. Therefore, it is **critical** that your application not use human-readable data to identify a user - human readable generally means someone will read it, and want to change it. Instead, use the claims provided by the OIDC standard, or the extension claims provided by Microsoft - the `sub` and `oid` claims.

To correctly store information per-user,  use `sub` or `oid` alone (which as GUIDs are unique), with `tid` used for routing or sharding if needed.  If you need to share data across services, `oid`+`tid` is best as all apps get the same `oid` and `tid` claims for a given user acting in a given tenant.  The `sub` claim in the Microsoft identity platform is "pair-wise" - it is unique based on a combination of the token recipient, tenant, and user.  Therefore, two apps that request ID tokens for a given user will receive different `sub` claims, but the same `oid` claims for that user.

>[!NOTE]
> Do not use the `idp` claim to store information about a user in an attempt to correlate users across tenants.  It will not function, as the `oid` and `sub` claims for a user change across tenants, by design, to ensure that applications cannot track users across tenants.  
>
> Guest scenarios, where a user is homed in one tenant, and authenticates in another, should treat the user as if they are a brand new user to the service.  Your documents and privileges in the Contoso tenant should not apply in the Fabrikam tenant. This is important to prevent accidental data leakage across tenants, and enforcement of data lifecycles.  Evicting a guest from a tenant should also remove their access to the data they created in that tenant. 

### Groups overage claim
To ensure that the token size doesn't exceed HTTP header size limits, Azure AD limits the number of object IDs that it includes in the `groups` claim. If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens), then Azure AD does not emit the groups claim in the token. Instead, it includes an overage claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the user's group membership.

```json
{
  ...
  "_claim_names": {
   "groups": "src1"
    },
    {
  "_claim_sources": {
    "src1": {
        "endpoint":"[Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }
       }
     }
  ...
}
```

## ID token lifetime

By default, an ID token is valid for one hour - after one hour, the client must acquire a new ID token.

You can adjust the lifetime of an ID token to control how often the client application expires the application session, and how often it requires the user to re-authenticate either silently or interactively. For more information, read [Configurable token lifetimes](active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes.md).

## Validating an ID token

Validating an ID token is similar to the first step of [validating an access token](access-tokens.md#validating-tokens). Your client can check whether the token has been tampered with. It can also validate the issuer to ensure that the correct issuer has sent back the token. Because ID tokens are always a JWT token, many libraries exist to validate these tokens - we recommend you use one of these rather than doing it yourself.  Note that only confidential clients (those with a secret) should validate ID tokens.  Public applications (code running entirely on a device or network you don't control such as a user's browser or their home network) don't benefit from validating the ID token. This is because a malicious user can intercept and edit the keys used for validation of the token.

To manually validate the token, see the steps details in [validating an access token](access-tokens.md#validating-tokens). The following JWT claims should be validated in the ID token After validating the signature on the token. These claims may also be validated by your token validation library:

* Timestamps: the `iat`, `nbf`, and `exp` timestamps should all fall before or after the current time, as appropriate.
* Audience: the `aud` claim should match the app ID for your application.
* Nonce: the `nonce` claim in the payload must match the nonce parameter passed into the /authorize endpoint during the initial request.

## Next steps

* Review the [OpenID Connect](v2-protocols-oidc.md) flow, which defines the protocols that emit an ID token. 
* Learn about [access tokens](access-tokens.md)
* Customize the JWT claims in your ID token using [optional claims](active-directory-optional-claims.md).
