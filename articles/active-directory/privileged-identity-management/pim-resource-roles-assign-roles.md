# Assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can manage the built-in Azure resource roles, as well as custom roles, including (but not limited to):

- Owner
- User Access Administrator
- Contributor
- Security Admin
- Security Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Users or members of a group assigned to the Owner or User Access Administrator subscription roles, and Azure AD Global administrators that enable subscription management in Azure AD have Resource administrator permissions by default. These administrators can assign roles, configure role settings, and review access using Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources. A user can't manage Privileged Identity Management for Resources without Resource administrator permissions. View the list of [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

Privileged Identity Management support both built-in and custom Azure roles. For more information on Azure custom roles, see [Azure custom roles](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md).

## Role assignment conditions

You can use the Azure attribute-based access control (Azure ABAC) preview to place resource conditions on eligible role assignments using Privileged Identity Management (PIM). With PIM, your end users must activate an eligible role assignment to get permission to perform certain actions. Using Azure attribute-based access control conditions in PIM enables you not only to limit a userâ€™s role permissions to a resource using fine-grained conditions, but also to use PIM to secure the role assignment with a time-bound setting, approval workflow, audit trail, and so on. For more information, see [Azure attribute-based access control public preview](../../role-based-access-control/conditions-overview.md).

>[!Note]
>When a role is assigned, the assignment:
>- Can't be assign for a duration of less than five minutes
>- Can't be removed within five minutes of it being assigned

## Assign a role

Follow these steps to make a user eligible for an Azure resource role.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with Owner or User Access Administrator role permissions.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

1. Use the resource filter to find the managed resources you're looking for.

    ![List of Azure resources to manage](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-list.png)

1. Select the resource that you want to manage to open the resource overview page.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Roles** to see the list of roles for Azure resources.

    ![Azure resources roles](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-roles.png)

1. Select **Add assignments** to open the **Add assignments** pane.

1. Select **Select a role** to open the **Select a role** page.

    ![New assignment pane](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-select-role.png)

1. Select a role you want to assign and then click **Select**.

    The **Select a member or group** pane opens.

1. Select a member or group you want to assign to the role and then click **Select**.

    ![Select a member or group pane](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-select-member-or-group.png)

1. On the **Settings** tab, in the **Assignment type** list, select **Eligible** or **Active**.

    ![Memberships settings pane](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-membership-settings-type.png)

    Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources provides two distinct assignment types:

    - **Eligible** assignments require the member of the role to perform an action to use the role. Actions might include performing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) check, providing a business justification, or requesting approval from designated approvers.

    - **Active** assignments don't require the member to perform any action to use the role. Members assigned as active have the privileges assigned to the role at all times.

1. To specify a specific assignment duration, change the start and end dates and times.

1. When finished, select **Assign**.

1. After the new role assignment is created, a status notification is displayed.

    ![New assignment - Notification](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-new-assignment-notification.png)

## Assign a role using ARM API

Privileged Identity Management supports Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API commands to manage Azure resource roles, as documented in the [PIM ARM API reference](/rest/api/authorization/roleeligibilityschedulerequests). For the permissions required to use the PIM API, see [Understand the Privileged Identity Management APIs](pim-apis.md).

The following is a sample HTTP request to create an eligible assignment for an Azure role.

## Update or remove an existing role assignment

Follow these steps to update or remove an existing role assignment.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

1. Select the resource you want to manage to open its overview page.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Roles** to see the list of roles for Azure resources.

    ![Azure resource roles - Select role](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-update-select-role.png)

1. Select the role that you want to update or remove.

1. Find the role assignment on the **Eligible roles** or **Active roles** tabs.

    ![Update or remove role assignment](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-update-remove.png)

1. To add or update a condition to refine Azure resource access, select **Add** or **View/Edit** in the **Condition** column for the role assignment.
