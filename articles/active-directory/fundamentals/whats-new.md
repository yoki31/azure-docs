## January 2022

### Public preview - Custom security attributes

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Directory Management  
**Product capability:** Directory  
 
Enables you to define business-specific attributes that you can assign to Azure AD objects. These attributes can be used to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control. Custom security attributes can be used with Azure attribute-based access control. [Learn more](custom-security-attributes-overview.md).
 
---

### Public preview - Filter groups in tokens using a substring match

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** SSO  
 
In the past, Azure AD only permitted groups to be filtered based on whether they were assigned to an application. Now, you can also use Azure AD to filter the groups included in the token. You can filter with the substring match on the display name or onPremisesSAMAccountName attributes of the group object on the token. Only groups that the user is a member of will be included in the token. This token will be recognized whether it's on the ObjectID or the on premises SAMAccountName or security identifier (SID). This feature can be used together with the setting to include only groups assigned to the application if desired to further filter the list.[Learn more](../hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md)

## December 2021

### Tenant enablement of combined security information registration for Azure Active Directory

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 
We previously announced in April 2020, a new combined registration experience enabling users to register authentication methods for SSPR and multi-factor authentication at the same time was generally available for existing customer to opt in. Any Azure AD tenants created after August 2020 automatically have the default experience set to combined registration.

---

### Pre-authentication error events removed from Azure AD Sign-in Logs

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting  
 
Weâ€™re no longer publishing sign-in logs with the following error codes because these events are pre-authentication events that occur before our service has authenticated a user. Because these events happen before authentication, our service isnâ€™t always able to correctly identify the user. If a user continues on to authenticate, the user sign-in will show up in your tenant Sign-in logs. These logs are no longer visible in the Azure portal UX, and querying these error codes in the Graph API will no longer return results.

|Error code | Failure reason|
| --- | --- |
|50058|	Session information isnâ€™t sufficient for single-sign-on.|
|16000| Either multiple user identities are available for the current request or selected account isnâ€™t supported for the scenario.|
|500581| Rendering JavaScript. Fetching sessions for single-sign-on on V2 with prompt=none requires JavaScript to verify if any MSA accounts are signed in.|
|81012| The user trying to sign in to Azure AD is different from the user signed into the device.|

## November 2021

### Tenant enablement of combined security information registration for Azure Active Directory

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
We previously announced in April 2020, a new combined registration experience enabling users to register authentication methods for SSPR and multi-factor authentication at the same time was generally available for existing customer to opt in. Any Azure AD tenants created after August 2020 automatically have the default experience set to combined registration. Starting 2022, Microsoft will be enabling the MFA/SSPR combined registration experience for existing customers. [Learn more](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).

### Windows users will see prompts more often when switching user accounts

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
A problematic interaction between Windows and a local Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) instance can result in users attempting to sign into another account, but be silently signed into their existing account instead, with no warning. For federated IdPs such as ADFS, that support the [prompt=login](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login) pattern, Azure AD will now trigger a fresh login at ADFS when a user is directed to ADFS with a login hint. This ensures that the user is signed into the account they requested, rather than being silently signed into the account they're already signed in with. 

For more information, see the [change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md).

This preview adds support for Conditional Access policies applied to service principals owned by the organization. You can block service principals from accessing resources from outside trusted-named locations or Azure Virtual Networks. [Learn more](../conditional-access/workload-identity.md).

---

### Public preview - Extra attributes available as claims

**Type:** Changed feature

[Learn more](../governance/entitlement-management-access-reviews-create.md).
 
---

### General availability - randomString and redact provisioning functions

## October 2021
 
### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Sometimes, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration will be enforced.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration mustn't exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions theyâ€™re configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and may not exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under API permissions for the application you wish to configure. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an [application](/graph/api/resources/application) entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Email one-time passcode on by default change beginning rollout in November 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Previously, we announced that starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) authentication will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios. However, because of deployment schedules, we'll begin rolling out on November 1, 2021. Most of the tenants will see the change rolled out in January 2022 to minimize disruptions during the holidays and deployment lock downs. After this change, Microsoft will no longer allow redemption of invitations using Azure Active Directory accounts that are unmanaged. [Learn more](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md#frequently-asked-questions).

### Conditional Access Guest Access Blocking Screen

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** End User Experiences
 
If there's no trust relation between a home and resource tenant, a guest user would have previously been asked to re-register their device, which would break the previous registration. However, the user would end up in a registration loop because only home tenant device registration is supported. In this specific scenario, instead of this loop, weâ€™ve created a new conditional access blocking page. The page tells the end user that they can't get access to conditional access protected resources as a guest user. [Learn more](../external-identities/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal.md#prerequisites).

### 50105 Errors will now result in a UX error message instead of an error response to the application

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Azure AD has fixed a bug in an error response that occurs when a user isn't assigned to an app that requires a user assignment. Previously, Azure AD would return error 50105 with the OIDC error code "interaction_required" even during interactive authentication. This would cause well-coded applications to loop indefinitely, as they do interactive authentication and receive an error telling them to do interactive authentication, which they would then do.  

The bug has been fixed, so that during non-interactive auth an "interaction_required" error will still be returned. Also, during interactive authentication an error page will be directly displayed to the user.  

For greater details, see the change notices for [Azure AD protocols](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#error-50105-has-been-fixed-to-not-return-interaction_required-during-interactive-authentication).

The following new capabilities have been added to the claims transformations available for manipulating claims in tokens issued from Azure AD:
 
- Join() on NameID. Used to be restricted to joining an email format address with a verified domain. Now Join() can be used on the NameID claim in the same way as any other claim, so NameID transforms can be used to create Windows account style NameIDs or any other string. For now if the result is an email address, the Azure AD will still validate that the domain is one that is verified in the tenant.
- Substring(). A new transformation in the claims configuration UI allows extraction of defined position substrings such as five characters starting at character three - substring(3,5)
- Claims transformations. These transformations can now be performed on Multi-valued attributes, and can emit multi-valued claims. Microsoft Graph can now be used to read/write multi-valued directory schema extension attributes. [Learn more](../develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization.md).

### General availability - Google deprecation of Gmail sign-in support on embedded webviews on September 30, 2021

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Google has deprecated Gmail sign-ins on Microsoft Teams mobile and custom apps that run Gmail authentications on embedded webviews on Sept. 30th, 2021.

If you would like to request an extension, impacted customers with affected OAuth client ID(s) should have received an email from Google Developers with the following information regarding a one-time policy enforcement extension, which must be completed by Jan 31, 2022.

To continue allowing your Gmail users to sign in and redeem, we strongly recommend that you refer toâ€¯[Embedded vs System Web](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) UIâ€¯in the MSAL.NET documentation and modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. 

As a workaround, we are deploying the device login flow by October 8. Between today and until then, it is likely that it may not be rolled out to all regions yet (in which case, end-users will be met with an error screen until it gets deployed to your region.) 

For more details on the device login flow and details on requesting extension to Google, see [Add Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

## September 2021

### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Occasionally, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, we're enforcing a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration must not exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out no sooner than mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they're configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and can't exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under Azure Active Directory > Application registrations > (select an application) > API permissions. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an application entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Single Page Apps using the `spa` redirect URI type must use a CORS enabled browser for auth

**Type:** Known issue  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
The modern Edge browser is now included in the requirement to provide an `Origin` header when redeeming a [single page app authorization code](../develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md#redirect-uri-setup-required-for-single-page-apps). A compatibility fix accidentally exempted the modern Edge browser from CORS controls, and that bug is being fixed during October. A subset of applications depended on CORS being disabled in the browser, which has the side effect of removing the `Origin` header from traffic. This is an unsupported configuration for using Azure AD, and these apps that depended on disabling CORS can no longer use modern Edge as a security workaround.  All modern browsers must now include the `Origin` header per HTTP spec, to ensure CORS is enforced. [Learn more](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#the-device-code-flow-ux-will-now-include-an-app-confirmation-prompt).

### Change from User Administrator to Identity Governance Administrator in Entitlement Management 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Roles

The permissions assignments to manage access packages and other resources in Entitlement Management are moving from the User Administrator role to the Identity Governance administrator role. 

Users that have been assigned the User administrator role can longer create catalogs or manage access packages in a catalog they don't own. If users in your organization have been assigned the User administrator role to configure catalogs, access packages, or policies in entitlement management, they will need a new assignment. You should instead assign these users the Identity Governance administrator role. [Learn more](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md)
