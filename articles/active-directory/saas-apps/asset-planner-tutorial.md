# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Asset Planner

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Asset Planner with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Asset Planner with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Asset Planner.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Asset Planner with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Asset Planner single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Asset Planner supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Asset Planner supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Asset Planner from the gallery

To configure the integration of Asset Planner into Azure AD, you need to add Asset Planner from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Asset Planner** in the search box.
1. Select **Asset Planner** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Asset Planner

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Asset Planner using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Asset Planner.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Asset Planner, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Asset Planner SSO](#configure-asset-planner-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Asset Planner test user](#create-asset-planner-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Asset Planner that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Asset Planner** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    | `https://staging.assetplanner.com` |
    | `https://training.assetplanner.com` |

	b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |------|
    | `https://assetplanner.com/saml/ap_acs/<IDPName>` |
    | `https://us.assetplanner.com/saml/ap_acs/<IDPName>` |
    | `https://staging.assetplanner.com/saml/ap_acs/<IDPName>` |
    | `https://training.assetplanner.com/saml/ap_acs/<IDPName>` |
    
    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:
    
    | **Sign on URL** |
    |-----|
    | `https://assetplanner.com` |
    | `https://us.assetplanner.com` |
    | `https://staging.assetplanner.com` |
    | `https://training.assetplanner.com` |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Asset Planner.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Asset Planner**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Asset Planner SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Asset Planner** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Asset Planner support team](mailto:support@assetplanner.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Asset Planner test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Asset Planner. Asset Planner supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Asset Planner, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Asset Planner Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Asset Planner Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Asset Planner tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Asset Planner Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Asset Planner you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
