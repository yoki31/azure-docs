# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with UltiPro Perception

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate UltiPro Perception with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate UltiPro Perception with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to UltiPro Perception.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to UltiPro Perception with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* UltiPro Perception single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* UltiPro Perception supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add UltiPro Perception from the gallery

To configure the integration of UltiPro Perception into Azure AD, you need to add UltiPro Perception from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **UltiPro Perception** in the search box.
1. Select **UltiPro Perception** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for UltiPro Perception

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with UltiPro Perception using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in UltiPro Perception.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with UltiPro Perception, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure UltiPro Perception SSO](#configure-ultipro-perception-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create UltiPro Perception test user](#create-ultipro-perception-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in UltiPro Perception that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **UltiPro Perception** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://perception.kanjoya.com/sso?idp=<entity_id>`

	b. The **UltiPro Perception** application requires the **Azure AD Identifier** value as <entity_id>, which you will get from the **Set up UltiPro Perception** section, to be URI-encoded. To get the URI-encoded value, use the following link: **http://www.url-encode-decode.com/**.

	c. After getting the URI-encoded value combine it with the **Reply URL** as mentioned below-

	`https://perception.kanjoya.com/sso?idp=<URI encooded entity_id>`
	
	d. Paste the above value in the **Reply URL** textbox.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create UltiPro Perception test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in UltiPro Perception. Work with [UltiPro Perception support team](https://www.ultimatesoftware.com/Contact/ContactUs) to add the users in the UltiPro Perception platform.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the UltiPro Perception for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the UltiPro Perception tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the UltiPro Perception for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure UltiPro Perception you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
