# Tutorial: Configure Autodesk SSO for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to do in both Autodesk SSO and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Autodesk SSO](https://autodesk.com/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Autodesk SSO.
> * Remove users in Autodesk SSO when they do not require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Autodesk SSO.
> * Provision groups and group memberships in Autodesk SSO.
> * [Single sign-on](autodesk-sso-tutorial.md) to Autodesk SSO (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md). 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* A user account with either Primary admin or SSO admin role to access [Autodesk management portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/).

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Autodesk SSO](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure Autodesk SSO to support provisioning with Azure AD
1. Login to [Autodesk management portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/).
1. From the left navigation menu, navigate to **User Management > By Group**. Select the required team from the drop-down list and click the team settings gear icon.

	[![Navigation](media/autodesk-sso-provisioning-tutorial/step2-1-navigation.png)](media/autodesk-sso-provisioning-tutorial/step2-1-navigation.png#lightbox)
	
2.  Click the Set up directory sync button and select Azure AD SCIM as the directory environment. Click Next to access the Azure admin credentials. If you set up Directory Sync before, click on the Access Credential instead.

	![Set Up Directory Sync](media/autodesk-sso-provisioning-tutorial/step2-2-set-up-directory-sync.png)

3. Copy and save the Base URL and API token. These values will be entered in the Tenant URL * field and Secret Token * field respectively in the Provisioning tab of your Autodesk application in the Azure portal.

## Step 3. Add Autodesk SSO from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Autodesk SSO from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Autodesk SSO. If you have previously setup Autodesk SSO for SSO, you can use the same application. However it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* When assigning users and groups to Autodesk SSO, you must select a role other than **Default Access**. Users with the Default Access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add more roles. 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Autodesk SSO 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and groups in Autodesk SSO based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Autodesk SSO in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Autodesk SSO**.

	![The Autodesk SSO link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Autodesk SSO Tenant URL and Secret Token. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Autodesk SSO. If the connection fails, ensure your Autodesk SSO account has Admin permissions and try again.

 	![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Autodesk SSO**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Autodesk SSO in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Autodesk SSO for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you'll need to ensure that the Autodesk SSO API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Autodesk SSO|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;|   
   |active|Boolean||&check;|
   |name.givenName|String||&check;|
   |name.familyName|String||&check;|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:AdskUserExt:2.0:User:objectGUID|String||&check;|


1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Autodesk SSO**.

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Autodesk SSO in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Autodesk SSO for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

      |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Autodesk SSO|
      |---|---|---|---|
      |displayName|String|&check;|&check;      
      |members|Reference|||
1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Autodesk SSO, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and groups that you would like to provision to Autodesk SSO by choosing the appropriate values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to execute than next cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).
