# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Zivver

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zivver with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Zivver with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Zivver.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zivver with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Zivver, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zivver single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Zivver supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Zivver from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zivver into Azure AD, you need to add Zivver from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zivver** in the search box.
1. Select **Zivver** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Zivver

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zivver using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zivver.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zivver, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Zivver SSO](#configure-zivver-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Zivver test user](#create-zivver-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Zivver that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Zivver** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following step:

    In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL:
    `https://app.zivver.com/SAML/Zivver`

5. Zivver application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Zivver application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

6. In addition to above, Zivver application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, perform the following steps to add SAML token attribute as shown in the below table:

	| Name | Namespace | Source Attribute |
	| ---------------|---------| ---------- |
	| ZivverAccountKey | https:\//zivver.com/SAML/Attributes | user.objectid |

	>[!NOTE]
	>If you are using a hybrid setup with Active Directory on-premises and Azure AD Connect Tool, VALUE should be set to `user.objectGUID`

	a. Click **Add new claim** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

	![Screenshot shows User claims with the option to Add new claim.](common/new-save-attribute.png)

	![Screenshot shows the Manage user claims dialog box where you can enter the values described.](common/new-attribute-details.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	d. Select Source as **Attribute**.

	e. From the **Source attribute** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	f. Click **Save**.

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** and click **Copy** icon to copy the **App Federation Metadata url** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

8. On the **Set up Zivver** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Zivver.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Zivver**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Zivver SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign in to your Zivver company [site](https://app.zivver.com/login) as an administrator.

2. Click the **Organization settings** icon at the bottom left of your browser window.

3. Go to **Single sign-on**.

4. Open the Federation Metadata XML file that you downloaded from Azure portal.

5. In the **Identity Provider metadata URL** text box, paste the **App Federation Metadata URL** you have saved previously from the Azure portal.

6. Check the checkbox **Turn on SSO**.

7. Click **SAVE**.

### Create Zivver test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Zivver. Work with [Zivver support team](https://support.zivver.com/) to add the users in the Zivver platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Zivver for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Zivver tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Zivver for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Zivver you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
