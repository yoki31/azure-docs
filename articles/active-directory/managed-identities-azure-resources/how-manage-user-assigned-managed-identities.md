# Manage user-assigned managed identities



Managed identities for Azure resources eliminate the need to manage credentials in code. You can use them to get an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) token your applications can use when you access resources that support Azure AD authentication. Azure manages the identity so you don't have to.

There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned. The main difference between them is that system-assigned managed identities have their lifecycle linked to the resource where they're used. User-assigned managed identities can be used on multiple resources. To learn more about managed identities, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](overview.md).

::: zone pivot="identity-mi-methods-azp"
In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types).
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.


## Create a user-assigned managed identity

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using an account associated with the Azure subscription to create the user-assigned managed identity.
1. In the search box, enter **Managed Identities**. Under **Services**, select **Managed Identities**.
1. Select **Add**, and enter values in the following boxes in the **Create User Assigned Managed Identity** pane:
    - **Subscription**: Choose the subscription to create the user-assigned managed identity under.
    - **Resource group**: Choose a resource group to create the user-assigned managed identity in, or select **Create new** to create a new resource group.
    - **Region**: Choose a region to deploy the user-assigned managed identity, for example, **West US**.
    - **Name**: Enter the name for your user-assigned managed identity, for example, UAI1.

::: zone pivot="identity-mi-methods-azcli"

In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using the Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). *Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)*.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.


[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To modify user permissions when you use an app service principal by using the CLI, you must provide the service principal more permissions in the Azure Active Directory Graph API because portions of the CLI perform GET requests against the Graph API. Otherwise, you might end up receiving an "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation" message. To do this step, go into the **App registration** in Azure AD, select your app, select **API permissions**, and scroll down and select **Azure Active Directory Graph**. From there, select **Application permissions**, and then add the appropriate permissions. 

## Create a user-assigned managed identity 

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

Use the [az identity create](/cli/azure/identity#az_identity_create) command to create a user-assigned managed identity. The `-g` parameter specifies the resource group where to create the user-assigned managed identity. The `-n` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values.

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
az identity create -g <RESOURCE GROUP> -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```
## List user-assigned managed identities

To list or read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To list user-assigned managed identities, use the [az identity list](/cli/azure/identity#az_identity_list) command. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` value with your own value.

```azurecli-interactive
az identity list -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
```

In the JSON response, user-assigned managed identities have the `"Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"` value returned for the key `type`.

`"type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"`

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, use the [az identity delete](/cli/azure/identity#az_identity_delete) command. The -n parameter specifies its name. The -g parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned managed identity was created. Replace the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` and `<RESOURCE GROUP>` parameter values with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
az identity delete -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME> -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
```
> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a user-assigned managed identity won't remove the reference from any resource it was assigned to. Remove those from a VM or virtual machine scale set by using the `az vm/vmss identity remove` command.

## Next steps

For a full list of Azure CLI identity commands, see [az identity](/cli/azure/identity).

For information on how to assign a user-assigned managed identity to an Azure VM, see [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on an Azure VM using Azure CLI](qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md#user-assigned-managed-identity).

::: zone pivot="identity-mi-methods-powershell"

In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using the PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). *Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)*.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.
- To run the example scripts, you have two options:
    - Use [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), which you can open by using the **Try It** button in the upper-right corner of code blocks.
    - Run scripts locally with Azure PowerShell, as described in the next section.

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete a user-assigned managed identity by using PowerShell.

### Configure Azure PowerShell locally

To use Azure PowerShell locally for this article instead of using Cloud Shell:

1. Install [the latest version of Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) if you haven't already.

1. Sign in to Azure.

    ```azurepowershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Install the [latest version of PowerShellGet](/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget#for-systems-with-powershell-50-or-newer-you-can-install-the-latest-powershellget).

    ```azurepowershell
    Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -AllowPrerelease
    ```

    You might need to `Exit` out of the current PowerShell session after you run this command for the next step.

1. Install the prerelease version of the `Az.ManagedServiceIdentity` module to perform the user-assigned managed identity operations in this article.

    ```azurepowershell
    Install-Module -Name Az.ManagedServiceIdentity -AllowPrerelease
    ```

## Create a user-assigned managed identity

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To create a user-assigned managed identity, use the `New-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command. The `ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where to create the user-assigned managed identity. The `-Name` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values.

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCEGROUP> -Name <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```

## List user-assigned managed identities

To list or read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To list user-assigned managed identities, use the [Get-AzUserAssigned] command. The `-ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned managed identity was created. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` value with your own value.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP>
```

In the response, user-assigned managed identities have the `"Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"` value returned for the key `Type`.

`Type :Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities`

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, use the `Remove-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command. The `-ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned identity was created. The `-Name` parameter specifies its name. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP> -Name <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a user-assigned managed identity won't remove the reference from any resource it was assigned to. Identity assignments must be removed separately.

::: zone pivot="identity-mi-methods-arm"

In this article, you create a user-assigned managed identity by using Azure Resource Manager.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). *Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)*.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.

You can't list and delete a user-assigned managed identity by using a Resource Manager template. See the following articles to create and list a user-assigned managed identity:

- [List user-assigned managed identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-cli.md#list-user-assigned-managed-identities)
- [Delete user-assigned managed identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-cli.md#delete-a-user-assigned-managed-identity)

## Template creation and editing

As with the Azure portal and scripting, Resource Manager templates provide the ability to deploy new or modified resources defined by an Azure resource group. Several options are available for template editing and deployment, both local and portal-based. You can:

- Use a [custom template from Azure Marketplace](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal.md#deploy-resources-from-custom-template) to create a template from scratch or base it on an existing common or [quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/).
- Derive from an existing resource group by exporting a template from either [the original deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#export-resource-groups-to-templates) or from the [current state of the deployment](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#export-resource-groups-to-templates).
- Use a local [JSON editor (such as VS Code)](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal.md), and then upload and deploy by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
- Use the Visual Studio [Azure Resource Group project](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/create-visual-studio-deployment-project.md) to create and deploy a template. 

## Create a user-assigned managed identity 

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

To create a user-assigned managed identity, use the following template. Replace the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` value with your own values.

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "resourceName": {
          "type": "string",
          "metadata": {
            "description": "<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>"
          }
        }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities",
      "name": "[parameters('resourceName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2018-11-30",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
      "identityName": {
          "type": "string",
          "value": "[parameters('resourceName')]"
      }
  }
}
```
