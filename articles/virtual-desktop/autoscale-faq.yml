    questions:
      - question: |
         How do I configure the autoscale feature so I run zero session hosts after working hours?
        answer: |
         Ramp-down mode always uses the lowest possible number of session hosts. However, if there are existing user sessions, the lowest number of usable session hosts won't be zero. To configure the time limit policy to sign out all disconnected users to avoid having usable session hosts after hours, go to **Local Computer Policy** > **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Session Time Limits** > **Set time limit for disconnected sessions**.

      - question: |
         Does autoscale create or delete virtual machines (VMs) based on service load?
        answer: |
         No.
      
      - question: |
         Does autoscale change the SKU or size of VMs?
        answer: |
         No.

      - question: |
         Can I configure scaling for specific dates like holidays?
        answer: |
         No. The autoscale feature  doesnâ€™t currently support ramping down on specific dates.

      - question: |
         Will I be charged extra for using the autoscale feature?
        answer: |
         No. For more information on rates, see [our pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-desktop/).
      
      - question: |
         What happens if the host pool capacity is equal to the capacity threshold?
        answer: |
         Nothing. The autoscale feature only reacts when the host pool capacity is greater than or less than the capacity threshold. The feature won't do anything when the host pool capacity is the same as the capacity threshold.

      - question: |
         If I set drain mode on session hosts, will the autoscale feature change my configured setting?
        answer: |
         Yes, the autoscale feature will still turn VMs in drain mode on or off, no matter who put it in drain mode. The autoscale feature overrides drain mode on all VMs included in scaling, so if you want to exclude a VM from scaling actions, you must use exclusion tags.
      
      - question: |
         How often does the autoscale feature monitor the session hosts and perform scaling evaluations?
        answer: |
         The autoscale feature monitors for when users sign in or out of their session hosts and categorizes this activity as session change events. Session change events trigger a scaling evaluation that creates logs. If there aren't any session change events or the event service has an outage, the autoscale feature then checks to see if it missed any events. When several session change events happen within a short time period, then the feature will batch the scaling evaluations. This batching allows the autoscale feature to process large numbers of events quickly without overloading the system.

      - question: |
         Can force sign-out happen in any phase of the day?
        answer: |
         No. If you've enabled the autoscale feature, you can only force users to sign out during the ramp-down phase. This means that if, during ramp-down, a session host is put in drain mode in preparation for it to be shut down but not all users get signed out before the phase changes to off-peak, the remaining user sessions will not be forced to sign out from their session. This is because during off-peak hours, users aren't forced to sign out of their sessions. Instead, the autoscale feature will wait until all users have signed out before deallocating the VM. For example, if the ramp-down phase is 15 minutes long, and the wait time before signing out users and shutting down VMs is 20 minutes long, the schedule will shift to the off-peak phase and the user sessions will not be forced to sign out.
      
      - question: |
         If I configure the autoscale feature to force users to sign out during ramp-down, will it also sign out users with active sessions?
        answer: |
         Yes. Idle, disconnected, and active sessions will be forced to sign out if the users don't sign out during the ramp-down phase wait time.

      - question: |
         If an active session is forced to sign out, but the user tries to reconnect, is there a way to prevent them from starting a new session on a session host that the autoscale feature is about to turn off?
        answer: |
         After the autoscale feature selects a session host to be shut down, it puts the session host in drain mode. Once all the user sessions have been signed out, the autoscale feature deallocates the VM. After deallocating the VM, the autoscale feature sets the AllowNewSessions setting to true, which turns off drain mode. Because sessions hosts that are about to be shut down are put in drain mode, a user who is forced to sign out of their session won't connect to a session host that is about to be shut down if they try to reconnect.

      - question: |
         Can the autoscale feature turn off all the VMs in a host pool, or does it need to keep at least a few VMs on to work properly?
        answer: |
         The autoscale feature can turn off all VMs in a host pool if the minimum percentage of hosts is set to **0%** and there are no user sessions on the session hosts in the host pool.

      - question: |
         How many VMs need to be in a host pool for the autoscale feature to work properly?
        answer: |
         At least one.
