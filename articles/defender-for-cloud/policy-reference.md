# Azure Policy built-in definitions for Microsoft Defender for Cloud

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions related to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. The following groupings of policy definitions are
available:

- The [initiatives](#microsoft-defender-for-cloud-initiatives) group lists the Azure Policy initiative definitions in the "Defender for Cloud" category.
- The [default initiative](#defender-for-clouds-default-initiative-azure-security-benchmark) group lists all the Azure Policy definitions that are part of Defender for Cloud's default initiative, [Azure Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction). This Microsoft-authored, widely respected benchmark builds on controls from the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) and the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) with a focus on cloud-centric security.
- The [category](#microsoft-defender-for-cloud-category) group lists all the Azure Policy definitions in the "Defender for Cloud" category.

For more information about security policies, see [Working with security policies](./tutorial-security-policy.md). For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see [Azure Policy built-in definitions](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use the link in the **Version** column to view the source on the [Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
