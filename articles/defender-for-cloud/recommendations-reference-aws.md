# Security recommendations for AWS resources - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud if you've connected an 
AWS account from the **Environment settings** page. The recommendations shown in your environment depend 
on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see
[Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on the number of security recommendations you've completed. To
