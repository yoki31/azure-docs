### Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager updated with new alerts and greater emphasis on high-risk operations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix

The cloud management layer is a crucial service connected to all your cloud resources. Because of this, it is also a potential target for attackers. Consequently, we recommend security operations teams closely monitor the resource management layer.

Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager automatically monitors the resource management operations in your organization, whether they're performed through the Azure portal, Azure REST APIs, Azure CLI, or other Azure programmatic clients. Defender for Cloud runs advanced security analytics to detect threats and alerts you about suspicious activity.

The plan's protections greatly enhance an organization's resiliency against attacks from threat actors and significantly increase the number of Azure resources protected by Defender for Cloud.

In December 2020, we introduced the preview of Defender for Resource Manager, and in May 2021 the plan was release for general availability. 

With this update, we've comprehensively revised the focus of the Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager plan. The updated plan includes many **new alerts focused on identifying suspicious invocation of high-risk operations**. These new alerts provide extensive monitoring for attacks across the *complete* [MITRE ATT&CK® matrix for cloud-based techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/).

This matrix covers the following range of potential intentions of threat actors who may be targeting your organization's resources: *Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact*.

The new alerts for this Defender plan cover these intentions as shown in the following table.

> [!TIP]
> These alerts also appear in the [alerts reference page](alerts-reference.md).

### Recommendations to enable Microsoft Defender plans on workspaces (in preview)

To benefit from all of the security features available from [Microsoft Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) and [Microsoft Defender for SQL on machines](defender-for-sql-introduction.md), the plans must be enabled on **both** the subscription and workspace levels. 

When a machine is in a subscription with one of these plan enabled, you'll be billed for the full protections. However, if that machine is reporting to a workspace *without* the plan enabled, you won't actually receive those benefits. 

We've added two recommendations that highlight workspaces without these plans enabled, that nevertheless have machines reporting to them from subscriptions that *do* have the plan enabled. 

The two recommendations, which both offer automated remediation (the 'Fix' action), are:

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|[Microsoft Defender for servers should be enabled on workspaces](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1ce68079-b783-4404-b341-d2851d6f0fa2) |Microsoft Defender for servers brings threat detection and advanced defenses for your Windows and Linux machines.<br>With this Defender plan enabled on your subscriptions but not on your workspaces, you're paying for the full capability of Microsoft Defender for servers but missing out on some of the benefits.<br>When you enable Microsoft Defender for servers on a workspace, all machines reporting to that workspace will be billed for Microsoft Defender for servers - even if they're in subscriptions without Defender plans enabled.

### Auto provision Log Analytics agent to Azure Arc-enabled machines (preview)

Defender for Cloud uses the Log Analytics agent to gather security-related data from machines. The agent reads various security-related configurations and event logs and copies the data to your workspace for analysis.

Defender for Cloud's auto provisioning settings have a toggle for each type of supported extension, including the Log Analytics agent. 

In a further expansion of our hybrid cloud features, we've added an option to auto provision the Log Analytics agent to machines connected to Azure Arc. 

As with the other other auto provisioning options, this is configured at the subscription level.

When you enable this option, you'll be prompted for the workspace. 

> [!NOTE]
> For this preview, you can't select the default workspaces that was created by Defender for Cloud. To ensure you receive the full set of security features available for the Azure Arc-enabled servers, verify that you have the relevant security solution installed on the selected workspace.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/auto-provisioning-agent-toggle.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of how to auto provision the Log Analytics agent to your Azure Arc-enabled machines." lightbox="./media/release-notes/auto-provisioning-agent-toggle.jpg":::

### Deprecated the recommendation to classify sensitive data in SQL databases

We've removed the recommendation **Sensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified** as part of an overhaul of how Defender for Cloud identifies and protects sensitive date in your cloud resources.

Advance notice of this change appeared for the last six months in the [Important upcoming changes to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](upcoming-changes.md) page.

### Communication with suspicious domain alert expanded to included known Log4Shell-related domains 

The following alert was previously only available to organizations who'd enabled the [Microsoft Defender for DNS](defender-for-dns-introduction.md) plan. 

With this update, the alert will also show for subscriptions with the [Microsoft Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) or [Defender for App Service](defender-for-app-service-introduction.md) plan enabled.

In addition, [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) has expanded the list of known malicious domains to include domains associated with exploiting the widely publicised vulnerabilities associated with Log4j.

| Alert (alert type)                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | MITRE tactics  | Severity |

| **Communication with suspicious domain identified by threat intelligence**<br>(AzureDNS_ThreatIntelSuspectDomain) | Communication with suspicious domain was detected by analyzing DNS transactions from your resource and comparing against known malicious domains identified by threat intelligence feeds. Communication to malicious domains is frequently performed by attackers and could imply that your resource is compromised.                                                                           | Initial Access / Persistence / Execution / Command And Control / Exploitation | Medium   |

### 'Copy alert JSON' button added to security alert details pane

To help our users quickly share an alert's details with others (for example, SOC analysts, resource owners, and developers) we've added the capability to easily extract all the details of a specific alert with one button from the security alert's details pane.

The new **Copy alert JSON** button puts the alert’s details, in JSON format, into the user's clipboard.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/copy-alert-json.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Copy alert JSON' button in the alert details pane." lightbox="./media/release-notes/copy-alert-json.png":::

### Renamed two recommendations

For consistency with other recommendation names, we've renamed the following two recommendations:

- Recommendation to resolve vulnerabilities discovered in running container images
    - Previous name: Vulnerabilities in running container images should be remediated (powered by Qualys)
    - New name: Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved

- Recommendation to enable diagnostic logs for Azure App Service
    - Previous name: Diagnostic logs should be enabled in App Service
    - New name: Diagnostic logs in App Service should be enabled

### Deprecate Kubernetes cluster containers should only listen on allowed ports policy

We have deprecated the **Kubernetes cluster containers should only listen on allowed ports** recommendation.

| Policy name | Description | Effect(s) | Version |
|--|--|--|--|
| [Kubernetes cluster containers should only listen on allowed ports](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F440b515e-a580-421e-abeb-b159a61ddcbc) | Restrict containers to listen only on allowed ports to secure access to the Kubernetes cluster. This policy is generally available for Kubernetes Service (AKS), and preview for AKS Engine and Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. For more information, see [https://aka.ms/kubepolicydoc](https://aka.ms/kubepolicydoc). | audit, deny, disabled | [6.1.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Kubernetes/ContainerAllowedPorts.json) |

The **[Services should listen on allowed ports only](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/add45209-73f6-4fa5-a5a5-74a451b07fbe)** recommendation should be used to limit ports that an application exposes to the internet.

### Added 'Active Alert' workbook

To assist our users in their understanding of the active threats to their environments, and prioritize between active alerts during the remediation process, we have added the Active Alerts workbook.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/active-alerts-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the addition of the Active alerts workbook.":::

The active alerts workbook allows users to view a unified dashboard of their aggregated alerts by severity, type, tag, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and location. Learn more in [Use the 'Active Alerts' workbook](custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks.md#use-the-active-alerts-workbook).

### 'System update' recommendation added to government cloud

The 'System updates should be installed on your machines' recommendation is now available on all government clouds.  

It's likely that this change will impact your government cloud subscription's secure score. We expect the change to lead to a decreased score, but it's possible the recommendation's inclusion might result in an increased score in some cases.

## December 2021

Updates in December include:

- [Microsoft Defender for Containers plan released for general availability (GA)](#microsoft-defender-for-containers-plan-released-for-general-availability-ga)
- [New alerts for Microsoft Defender for Storage released for general availability (GA)](#new-alerts-for-microsoft-defender-for-storage-released-for-general-availability-ga)
- [Improvements to alerts for Microsoft Defender for Storage](#improvements-to-alerts-for-microsoft-defender-for-storage)
- ['PortSweeping' alert removed from network layer alerts](#portsweeping-alert-removed-from-network-layer-alerts)

### Microsoft Defender for Containers plan released for general availability (GA)

Over two years ago, we introduced [Defender for Kubernetes](defender-for-kubernetes-introduction.md) and [Defender for container registries](defender-for-container-registries-introduction.md) as part of the Azure Defender offering within Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

With the release of [Microsoft Defender for Containers](defender-for-containers-introduction.md), we've merged these two existing Defender plans. 

The new plan:

- **Combines the features of the two existing plans** - threat detection for Kubernetes clusters and vulnerability assessment for images stored in container registries
- **Brings new and improved features** - including multi-cloud support, host level threat detection with over **sixty** new Kubernetes-aware analytics, and vulnerability assessment for running images
- **Introduces Kubernetes-native at-scale onboarding** - by default, when you enable the plan all relevant components are configured to be deployed automatically

With this release, the availability and presentation of Defender for Kubernetes and Defender for container registries has changed as follows:

- New subscriptions - The two previous container plans are no longer available
- Existing subscriptions - Wherever they appear in the Azure portal, the plans are shown as **Deprecated** with instructions for how to upgrade to the newer plan

### New alerts for Microsoft Defender for Storage released for general availability (GA)

Threat actors use tools and scripts to scan for publicly open containers in the hope of finding misconfigured open storage containers with sensitive data.

Microsoft Defender for Storage detects these scanners so that you can block them and remediate your posture.

The preview alert that detected this was called **“Anonymous scan of public storage containers”**. To provide greater clarity about the suspicious events discovered, we've divided this into **two** new alerts. These alerts are relevant to Azure Blob Storage only.

We have improved the detection logic, updated the alert metadata, and changed the alert name and alert type.

These are the new alerts:

| Alert   (alert type)                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | MITRE tactic | Severity |

- [List of alerts provided by Microsoft Defender for Storage](alerts-reference.md#alerts-azurestorage)


### Improvements to alerts for Microsoft Defender for Storage

The initial access alerts now have improved accuracy and more data to support investigation.

Threat actors use various techniques in the initial access to gain a foothold within a network. Two of the [Microsoft Defender for Storage](defender-for-storage-introduction.md) alerts that detect behavioral anomalies in this stage now have improved detection logic and additional data to support investigations. 

If you've [configured automations](workflow-automation.md) or defined [alert suppression rules](alerts-suppression-rules.md) for these alerts in the past, update them in accordance with these changes. 

#### Detecting access from a Tor exit node

Access from a Tor exit node might indicate a threat actor trying to hide their identity. 

The alert is now tuned to generate only for authenticated access, which results in higher accuracy and confidence that the activity is malicious. This enhancement reduces the benign positive rate.  

An outlying pattern will have high severity, while less anomalous patterns will have medium severity. 
 
The alert name and description have been updated. The AlertType remains unchanged. 

- Alert name (old): Access from a Tor exit node to a storage account 
- Alert name (new): Authenticated access from a Tor exit node 
- Alert types:  Storage.Blob_TorAnomaly / Storage.Files_TorAnomaly
- Description: One or more storage container(s) / file share(s) in your storage account were successfully accessed from an IP address known to be an active exit node of Tor (an anonymizing proxy). Threat actors use Tor to make it difficult to trace the activity back to them. Authenticated access from a Tor exit node is a likely indication that a threat actor is trying to hide their identity. Applies to: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- MITRE tactic: Initial access
- Severity: High/Medium

#### Unusual unauthenticated access 

A change in access patterns may indicate that a threat actor was able to exploit public read access to storage containers, either by exploiting a mistake in access configurations, or by changing the access permissions. 

This medium severity alert is now tuned with improved behavioral logic, higher accuracy, and confidence that the activity is malicious. This enhancement reduces the benign positive rate. 

The alert name and description have been updated. The AlertType remains unchanged. 
 
- Alert name (old): Anonymous access to a storage account 
- Alert name (new): Unusual unauthenticated access to a storage container
- Alert types: Storage.Blob_AnonymousAccessAnomaly
- Description: This storage account was accessed without authentication, which is a change in the common access pattern. Read access to this container is usually authenticated. This might indicate that a threat actor was able to exploit public read access to storage container(s) in this storage account(s). Applies to: Azure Blob Storage
- MITRE tactic: Collection 
- Severity: Medium

For more information, see:

### 'PortSweeping' alert removed from network layer alerts

The following alert was removed from our network layer alerts due to inefficiencies:

| Alert (alert type)                                                                                                                                               | Description     | MITRE tactics | Severity      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------:|---------------|
| **Possible outgoing port scanning activity detected**<br>(PortSweeping) | Network traffic analysis detected suspicious outgoing traffic from %{Compromised Host}. This traffic may be a result of a port scanning activity. When the compromised resource is a load balancer or an application gateway, the suspected outgoing traffic has been originated from to one or more of the resources in the backend pool (of the load balancer or application gateway). If this behavior is intentional, please note that performing port scanning is against Azure Terms of service. If this behavior is unintentional, it may mean your resource has been compromised. | Discovery | Medium   |

### Azure Security Center and Azure Defender become Microsoft Defender for Cloud

According to the [2021 State of the Cloud report](https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud#download), 92% of organizations now have a multi-cloud strategy. At Microsoft, our goal is to centralize security across these environments and help security teams work more effectively.

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** (formerly known as Azure Security Center and Azure Defender) is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection (CWP) solution that discovers weaknesses across your cloud configuration, helps strengthen the overall security posture of your environment, and protects workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.

At Ignite 2019, we shared our vision to create the most complete approach for securing your digital estate and integrating XDR technologies under the Microsoft Defender brand. Unifying Azure Security Center and Azure Defender under the new name **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, reflects the integrated capabilities of our security offering and our ability to support any cloud platform.


### Native CSPM for AWS and threat protection for Amazon EKS, and AWS EC2

A new **environment settings** page provides greater visibility and control over your management groups, subscriptions, and AWS accounts. The page is designed to onboard AWS accounts at scale: connect your AWS **management account**, and you'll automatically onboard existing and future accounts. 

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/add-aws-account.png" alt-text="Use the new environment settings page to connect your AWS accounts.":::

When you've added your AWS accounts, Defender for Cloud protects your AWS resources with any or all of the following plans:

- **Defender for Cloud's CSPM features** extend to your AWS resources. This agentless plan assesses your AWS resources according to AWS-specific security recommendations and these are included in your secure score. The resources will also be assessed for compliance with built-in standards specific to AWS (AWS CIS, AWS PCI DSS, and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices). Defender for Cloud's [asset inventory page](asset-inventory.md) is a multi-cloud enabled feature helping you manage your AWS resources alongside your Azure resources.
- **Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes** extends its container threat detection and advanced defenses to your **Amazon EKS Linux clusters**.
- **Microsoft Defender for servers** brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your Windows and Linux EC2 instances. This plan includes the integrated license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, security baselines and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more.

Learn more about [connecting your AWS accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](quickstart-onboard-aws.md).


### Prioritize security actions by data sensitivity (powered by Azure Purview) (in preview)
Data resources remain a popular target for threat actors. So it's crucial for security teams to identify, prioritize, and secure sensitive data resources across their cloud environments.

To address this challenge, Microsoft Defender for Cloud now integrates sensitivity information from [Azure Purview](../purview/overview.md). Azure Purview is a unified data governance service that provides rich insights into the sensitivity of your data within multi-cloud, and on-premises workloads.

The integration with Azure Purview extends your security visibility in Defender for Cloud from the infrastructure level down to the data, enabling an entirely new way to prioritize resources and security activities for your security teams.

Learn more in [Prioritize security actions by data sensitivity](information-protection.md).


### Expanded security control assessments with Azure Security Benchmark v3
Microsoft Defender for Cloud's security recommendations are enabled and supported by the Azure Security Benchmark. 

[Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/introduction.md) is the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. This widely respected benchmark builds on the controls from the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) and the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) with a focus on cloud-centric security.

From Ignite 2021, Azure Security Benchmark **v3** is available in [Defender for Cloud's regulatory compliance dashboard](update-regulatory-compliance-packages.md) and enabled as the new default initiative for all Azure subscriptions protected with Microsoft
Defender for Cloud. 

Enhancements for v3 include: 

- Additional mappings to industry frameworks [PCI-DSS v3.2.1](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf) and [CIS Controls v8](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/).
- More granular and actionable guidance for controls with the introduction of:
    - **Security Principles** - Providing insight into the overall security objectives that build the foundation for our recommendations.
    - **Azure Guidance** - The technical “how-to” for meeting these objectives.

- New controls include DevOps security for issues such as threat modeling and software supply chain security, as well as key and certificate management for best practices in Azure.

Learn more in [Introduction to Azure Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction).


### Microsoft Sentinel connector's optional bi-directional alert synchronization released for general availability (GA)

In July, [we announced](release-notes-archive.md#azure-sentinel-connector-now-includes-optional-bi-directional-alert-synchronization-in-preview) a preview feature, **bi-directional alert synchronization**, for the built-in connector in [Microsoft Sentinel](../sentinel/index.yml) (Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution). This feature is now released for general availability (GA).

When you connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Microsoft Sentinel, the status of security alerts is synchronized between the two services. So, for example, when an alert is closed in Defender for Cloud, that alert will display as closed in Microsoft Sentinel as well. Changing the status of an alert in Defender for Cloud won't affect the status of any Microsoft Sentinel **incidents** that contain the synchronized Microsoft Sentinel alert, only that of the synchronized alert itself.

When you enable **bi-directional alert synchronization** you'll automatically sync the status of the original Defender for Cloud alerts with Microsoft Sentinel incidents that contain the copies of those Defender for Cloud alerts. So, for example, when a Microsoft Sentinel incident containing a Defender for Cloud alert is closed, Defender for Cloud will automatically close the corresponding original alert.

Learn more in [Connect Azure Defender alerts from Azure Security Center](../sentinel/connect-azure-security-center.md) and [Stream alerts to Azure Sentinel](export-to-siem.md#stream-alerts-to-microsoft-sentinel).

### New recommendation to push Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) logs to Sentinel

In a further enhancement to the combined value of Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel, we'll now highlight Azure Kubernetes Service instances that aren't sending log data to Microsoft Sentinel.

SecOps teams can choose the relevant Microsoft Sentinel workspace directly from the recommendation details page and immediately enable the streaming of raw logs. This seamless connection between the two products makes it easy for security teams to ensure complete logging coverage across their workloads to stay on top of their entire environment.

The new recommendation, "Diagnostic logs in Kubernetes services should be enabled" includes the 'Fix' option for faster remediation.

We've also enhanced the "Auditing on SQL server should be enabled" recommendation with the same Sentinel streaming capabilities. 


### Recommendations mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework - released for general availability (GA)

We've enhanced Defender for Cloud's security recommendations to show their position on the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. This globally accessible knowledge base of threat actors' tactics and techniques based on real-world observations, provides more context to help you understand the associated risks of the recommendations for your environment.

You'll find these tactics wherever you access recommendation information:

- **Azure Resource Graph query results** for relevant recommendations include the MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques.

- **Recommendation details pages** show the mapping for all relevant recommendations:

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-security-recommendations/tactics-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the MITRE tactics mapping for a recommendation.":::

- **The recommendations page in Defender for Cloud** has a new :::image type="icon" source="media/review-security-recommendations/tactics-filter-recommendations-page.png" border="false"::: filter to select recommendations according to their associated tactic:

Learn more in [Review your security recommendations](review-security-recommendations.md).

### Microsoft Threat and Vulnerability Management added as vulnerability assessment solution - released for general availability (GA)

In October, [we announced](#microsoft-threat-and-vulnerability-management-added-as-vulnerability-assessment-solution-in-preview) an extension to the integration between [Microsoft Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, to support a new vulnerability assessment provider for your machines: [Microsoft threat and vulnerability management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt). This feature is now released for general availability (GA).

Use **threat and vulnerability management** to discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time with the [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) enabled, and without the need for additional agents or periodic scans. Threat and vulnerability management prioritizes vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization.

Use the security recommendation "[A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ffff0522-1e88-47fc-8382-2a80ba848f5d)" to surface the vulnerabilities detected by threat and vulnerability management for your [supported machines](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-supported-os?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). 

To automatically surface the vulnerabilities, on existing and new machines, without the need to manually remediate the recommendation, see [Vulnerability assessment solutions can now be auto enabled (in preview)](#vulnerability-assessment-solutions-can-now-be-auto-enabled-in-preview).

Learn more in [Investigate weaknesses with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's threat and vulnerability management](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-tvm.md).

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux now supported by Microsoft Defender for servers - released for general availability (GA)

In August, [we announced](#microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-for-linux-now-supported-by-azure-defender-for-servers-in-preview) preview support for deploying the [Defender for Endpoint for Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux) sensor to supported Linux machines. This feature is now released for general availability (GA).

[Microsoft Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) includes an integrated license for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender). Together, they provide comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.

When Defender for Endpoint detects a threat, it triggers an alert. The alert is shown in Defender for Cloud. From Defender for Cloud, you can also pivot to the Defender for Endpoint console, and perform a detailed investigation to uncover the scope of the attack.

Learn more in [Protect your endpoints with Security Center's integrated EDR solution: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).


### Snapshot export for recommendations and security findings (in preview)

Defender for Cloud generates detailed security alerts and recommendations. You can view them in the portal or through programmatic tools. You might also need to export some or all of this information for tracking with other monitoring tools in your environment.

Defender for Cloud's **continuous export** feature lets you fully customize *what* will be exported, and *where* it will go. Learn more in [Continuously export Microsoft Defender for Cloud data](continuous-export.md).

Even though the feature is called *continuous*, there's also an option to export weekly snapshots. Until now, these weekly snapshots were limited to secure score and regulatory compliance data. We've  added the capability to export recommendations and security findings.

### Auto provisioning of vulnerability assessment solutions released for general availability (GA)

In October, [we announced](#vulnerability-assessment-solutions-can-now-be-auto-enabled-in-preview) the addition of vulnerability assessment solutions to Defender for Cloud's auto provisioning page. This is relevant to Azure virtual machines and Azure Arc machines on subscriptions protected by [Azure Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md). This feature is now released for general availability (GA).

If the [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) is enabled, Defender for Cloud presents a choice of vulnerability assessment solutions:

- (**NEW**) The Microsoft threat and vulnerability management module of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (see [the release note](#microsoft-threat-and-vulnerability-management-added-as-vulnerability-assessment-solution---released-for-general-availability-ga))
- The integrated Qualys agent

Your chosen solution will be automatically enabled on supported machines.

Learn more in [Automatically configure vulnerability assessment for your machines](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md).

### Software inventory filters in asset inventory released for general availability (GA)

In October, [we announced](#software-inventory-filters-added-to-asset-inventory-in-preview) new filters for the [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md) page to select machines running specific software - and even specify the versions of interest. This feature is now released for general availability (GA).

You can query the software inventory data in **Azure Resource Graph Explorer**.

To use these features, you'll need to enable the [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md). 

For full details, including sample Kusto queries for Azure Resource Graph, see [Access a software inventory](asset-inventory.md#access-a-software-inventory).

### New AKS security policy added to default initiative – for use by private preview customers only

To ensure that Kubernetes workloads are secure by default, Defender for Cloud includes Kubernetes level policies and hardening recommendations, including enforcement options with Kubernetes admission control.

As part of this project, we've added a policy and recommendation (disabled by default) for gating deployment on Kubernetes clusters. The policy is in the default initiative but is only relevant for organizations who register for the related private preview.

You can safely ignore the policies and recommendation ("Kubernetes clusters should gate deployment of vulnerable images") and there will be no impact on your environment. 

If you'd like to participate in the private preview, you'll need to be a member of the private preview ring. If you're not already a member, submit a request [here](https://aka.ms/atscale). Members will be notified when the preview begins.

### Inventory display of on-premises machines applies different template for resource name

To improve the presentation of resources in the [Asset inventory](asset-inventory.md), we've removed the "source-computer-IP" element from the template for naming on-premises machines.

- **Previous format:** ``machine-name_source-computer-id_VMUUID``
- **From this update:** ``machine-name_VMUUID``

In July 2021, we announced a [logical reorganization of Azure Defender for Resource Manager alerts](release-notes-archive.md#logical-reorganization-of-azure-defender-for-resource-manager-alerts) 

As part of a logical reorganization of some of the Azure Defender plans, we moved twenty-one alerts from [Azure Defender for Resource Manager](defender-for-resource-manager-introduction.md) to [Azure Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md).

With this update, we've changed the prefixes of these alerts to match this reassignment and replaced "ARM_" with "VM_" as shown in the following table:

| Original name                                  | From this change                              |

### Changes to the logic of a security recommendation for Kubernetes clusters

The recommendation "Kubernetes clusters should not use the default namespace" prevents usage of the default namespace for a range of resource types. Two of the resource types that were included in this recommendation have been removed: ConfigMap and Secret. 

Learn more about this recommendation and hardening your Kubernetes clusters in [Understand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md).

### Recommendations details pages now show related recommendations

To clarify the relationships between different recommendations, we've added a **Related recommendations** area to the details pages of many recommendations. 

The three relationship types that are shown on these pages are:

- **Prerequisite** - A recommendation that must be completed before the selected recommendation
- **Alternative** - A different recommendation which provides another way of achieving the goals of the selected recommendation
- **Dependent** - A recommendation for which the selected recommendation is a prerequisite

For each related recommendation, the number of unhealthy resources is shown in the "Affected resources" column.

> [!TIP]
> If a related recommendation is grayed out, its dependency isn't yet completed and so isn't available.

An example of related recommendations:

1. Security Center checks your machines for supported vulnerability assessment solutions:<br>
    **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines**

1. If one is found, you'll get notified about discovered vulnerabilities:<br>
    **Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated**

Obviously, Security Center can't notify you about discovered vulnerabilities unless it finds a supported vulnerability assessment solution.

Therefore:

 - Recommendation #1 is a prerequisite for recommendation #2
 - Recommendation #2 depends upon recommendation #1

### New alerts for Azure Defender for Kubernetes (in preview)

To expand the threat protections provided by Azure Defender for Kubernetes, we've added two preview alerts.

These alerts are generated based on a new machine learning model and Kubernetes advanced analytics, measuring multiple deployment and role assignment attributes against previous activities in the cluster and across all clusters monitored by Azure Defender.

| Alert (alert type)                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | MITRE tactic | Severity |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------:|----------|
| **Anomalous pod deployment (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AnomalousPodDeployment)             | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected pod deployment that is anomalous based on previous pod deployment activity. This activity is considered an anomaly when taking into account how the different features seen in the deployment operation are in relations to one another. The features monitored by this analytics include the container image registry used, the account performing the deployment, day of the week, how often does this account performs pod deployments, user agent used in the operation, is this a namespace which is pod deployment occur to often, or other feature. Top contributing reasons for raising this alert as anomalous activity are detailed under the alert extended properties. | Execution | Medium |
| **Excessive role permissions assigned in Kubernetes cluster (Preview)**<br>(K8S_ServiceAcountPermissionAnomaly) | Analysis of the Kubernetes audit logs detected an excessive permissions role assignment to your cluster. From examining role assignments, the listed permissions are uncommon to the specific service account. This detection considers previous role assignments to the same service account across clusters monitored by Azure, volume per permission, and the impact of the specific permission. The anomaly detection model used for this alert takes into account how this permission is used across all clusters monitored by Azure Defender. | Privilege Escalation | Low |

## September 2021

In September, the following update was released:

### Two new recommendations to audit OS configurations for Azure security baseline compliance (in preview)

The following two recommendations have been released to assess your machines' compliance with the [Windows security baseline](../governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-windows.md) and the [Linux security baseline](../governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-linux.md):

- For Windows machines, [Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Windows machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1f655fb7-63ca-4980-91a3-56dbc2b715c6)
- For Linux machines, [Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Linux machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/8c3d9ad0-3639-4686-9cd2-2b2ab2609bda)

These recommendations make use of the guest configuration feature of Azure Policy to compare the OS configuration of a machine with the baseline defined in the [Azure Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/overview).

Learn more about using these recommendations in [Harden a machine's OS configuration using guest configuration](apply-security-baseline.md).

## August 2021

- [Recommendations page now includes multiple views](#recommendations-page-now-includes-multiple-views)

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux now supported by Azure Defender for servers (in preview)

[Azure Defender for servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) includes an integrated license for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender). Together, they provide comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.

When Defender for Endpoint detects a threat, it triggers an alert. The alert is shown in Security Center. From Security Center, you can also pivot to the Defender for Endpoint console, and perform a detailed investigation to uncover the scope of the attack.

During the preview period, you'll deploy the [Defender for Endpoint for Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux) sensor to supported Linux machines in one of two ways depending on whether you've already deployed it to your Windows machines:

- [Existing users with Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features enabled and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Windows](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#existing-users-with-defender-for-clouds-enhanced-security-features-enabled-and-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-for-windows)
- [New users who have never enabled the integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Windows](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md?tabs=linux#new-users-whove-never-enabled-the-integration-with-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-for-windows)

Learn more in [Protect your endpoints with Security Center's integrated EDR solution: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).

### Two new recommendations for managing endpoint protection solutions (in preview)

We've added two **preview** recommendations to deploy and maintain the endpoint protection solutions on your machines. Both recommendations include support for Azure virtual machines and machines connected to Azure Arc-enabled servers.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|[Endpoint protection should be installed on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4fb67663-9ab9-475d-b026-8c544cced439) |To protect your machines from threats and vulnerabilities, install a supported endpoint protection solution.  <br> <a href="/azure/defender-for-cloud/endpoint-protection-recommendations-technical">Learn more about how Endpoint Protection for machines is evaluated.</a><br />(Related policy: [Monitor missing Endpoint Protection in Azure Security Center](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2faf6cd1bd-1635-48cb-bde7-5b15693900b9)) |High |

> [!NOTE]
> The recommendations show their freshness interval as 8 hours, but there are some scenarios in which this might take significantly longer. For example, when an on premises machine is deleted, it takes 24 hours for Security Center to identify the deletion. After that, the assessment will take up to 8 hours to return the information. In that specific situation therefore, it may take 32 hours for the machine to be removed from the list of affected resources.

### Built-in troubleshooting and guidance for solving common issues

A new, dedicated area of the Security Center pages in the Azure portal provides a collated, ever-growing set of self-help materials for solving common challenges with Security Center and Azure Defender.

When you're facing an issue, or are seeking advice from our support team, **Diagnose and solve problems** is another tool to help you find the solution:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/solve-problems.png" alt-text="Security Center's 'Diagnose and solve problems' page":::
 

### Regulatory compliance dashboard's Azure Audit reports released for general availability (GA)

The regulatory compliance dashboard's toolbar offers Azure and Dynamics certification reports for the standards applied to your subscriptions. 

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/audit-reports-regulatory-compliance-dashboard.png" alt-text="Regulatory compliance dashboard's toolbar showing the button for generating audit reports.":::

You can select the tab for the relevant reports types (PCI, SOC, ISO, and others) and use filters to find the specific reports you need.

For more information, see [Generate compliance status reports and certificates](regulatory-compliance-dashboard.md#generate-compliance-status-reports-and-certificates).

### Deprecated recommendation 'Log Analytics agent health issues should be resolved on your machines'

We've found that recommendation **Log Analytics agent health issues should be resolved on your machines** impacts secure scores in ways that are inconsistent with Security Center's Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) focus. Typically, CSPM relates to identifying security misconfigurations. Agent health issues don't fit into this category of issues.

Also, the recommendation is an anomaly when compared with the other agents related to Security Center: this is the only agent with a recommendation related to health issues.

The recommendation has been deprecated.

As a result of this deprecation, we've also made minor changes to the recommendations for installing the Log Analytics agent (**Log Analytics agent should be installed on...**).

It's likely that this change will impact your secure scores. For most subscriptions, we expect the change to lead to an increased score, but it's possible the updates to the installation recommendation might result in decreased scores in some cases.

> [!TIP]
> The [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md) page was also affected by this change as it displays the monitored status for machines (monitored, not monitored, or partially monitored - a state which refers to an agent with health issues).


### Azure Defender for container registries now scans for vulnerabilities in registries protected with Azure Private Link
Azure Defender for container registries includes a vulnerability scanner to scan images in your Azure Container Registry registries. Learn how to scan your registries and remediate findings in [Use Azure Defender for container registries to scan your images for vulnerabilities](defender-for-container-registries-usage.md).

To limit access to a registry hosted in Azure Container Registry, assign virtual network private IP addresses to the registry endpoints and use Azure Private Link as explained in [Connect privately to an Azure container registry using Azure Private Link](../container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md).

As part of our ongoing efforts to support additional environments and use cases, Azure Defender now also scans container registries protected with [Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md).


### Security Center can now auto provision the Azure Policy's Guest Configuration extension (in preview)
Azure Policy can audit settings inside a machine, both for machines running in Azure and Arc connected machines. The validation is performed by the Guest Configuration extension and client. Learn more in [Understand Azure Policy's Guest Configuration](../governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration.md).

With this update, you can now set Security Center to automatically provision this extension to all supported machines. 

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/auto-provisioning-guest-configuration.png" alt-text="Enable auto deployment of Guest Configuration extension.":::

Learn more about how auto provisioning works in [Configure auto provisioning for agents and extensions](enable-data-collection.md).

### Recommendations to enable Azure Defender plans now support "Enforce"
Security Center includes two features that help ensure newly created resources are provisioned in a secure manner: **enforce** and **deny**. When a recommendation offers these options, you can ensure your security requirements are met whenever someone attempts to create a resource:

- **Deny** stops unhealthy resources from being created
- **Enforce** automatically remediates non-compliant resources when they're created

With this update, the enforce option is now available on the recommendations to enable Azure Defender plans (such as **Azure Defender for App Service should be enabled**, **Azure Defender for Key Vault should be enabled**, **Azure Defender for Storage should be enabled**).

Learn more about these options in [Prevent misconfigurations with Enforce/Deny recommendations](prevent-misconfigurations.md).

### CSV exports of recommendation data now limited to 20 MB

We're instituting a limit of 20 MB when exporting Security Center recommendations data.

:::image type="content" source="media/upcoming-changes/download-csv-report.png" alt-text="Security Center's 'download CSV report' button to export recommendation data.":::

If you need to export larger amounts of data, use the available filters before selecting, or select subsets of your subscriptions and download the data in batches.

Learn more about [performing a CSV export of your security recommendations](continuous-export.md#manual-one-time-export-of-alerts-and-recommendations).



### Recommendations page now includes multiple views

The recommendations page now has two tabs to provide alternate ways to view the recommendations relevant to your resources:

- **Secure score recommendations** - Use this tab to view the list of recommendations grouped by security control. Learn more about these controls in [Security controls and their recommendations](secure-score-security-controls.md#security-controls-and-their-recommendations).
- **All recommendations** - Use this tab to view the list of recommendations as a flat list. This tab is also great for understanding which initiative (including regulatory compliance standards) generated the recommendation. Learn more about initiatives and their relationship to recommendations in [What are security policies, initiatives, and recommendations?](security-policy-concept.md).
