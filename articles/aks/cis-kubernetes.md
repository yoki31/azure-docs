# Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes benchmark

As a secure service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) complies with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards. This article covers the security hardening applied to AKS based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. For more information about AKS security, see [Security concepts for applications and clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./concepts-security.md). For more information on the CIS benchmark, see [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks][cis-benchmarks].

## Kubernetes CIS benchmark

The following are the results from the [CIS Kubernetes V1.20 Benchmark v1.0.0][cis-benchmark-kubernetes] recommendations on AKS.

*Scored* recommendations affect the benchmark score if they are not applied, while *Not Scored* recommendations don't.

CIS benchmarks provide two levels of security settings:

* *L1*, or Level 1, recommends essential basic security requirements that can be configured on any system and should cause little or no interruption of service or reduced functionality.
* *L2*, or Level 2, recommends security settings for environments requiring greater security that could result in some reduced functionality.

Recommendations can have one of the following statuses:

* *Pass* - The recommendation has been applied.
* *Fail* - The recommendation has not been applied.
* *N/A* - The recommendation relates to manifest file permission requirements that are not relevant to AKS. Kubernetes clusters by default use a manifest model to deploy the control plane pods, which rely on files from the node VM. The CIS Kubernetes benchmark recommends these files must have certain permission requirements. AKS clusters use a Helm chart to deploy control plane pods and don't rely on files in the node VM.
* *Depends on Environment* - The recommendation is applied in the user's specific environment and is not controlled by AKS. *Scored* recommendations affect the benchmark score whether the recommendation applies to the user's specific environment or not.
* *Equivalent Control* - The recommendation has been implemented in a different, equivalent manner.

> In addition to the Kubernetes CIS benchmark, there is an [AKS CIS benchmark][cis-benchmark-aks] available as well.

## Additional notes

* The security hardened OS is built and maintained specifically for AKS and is **not** supported outside of the AKS platform.
* To further reduce the attack surface area, some unnecessary kernel module drivers have been disabled in the OS.
