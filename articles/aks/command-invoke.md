# Use `command invoke` to access a private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Accessing a private AKS cluster requires that you connect to that cluster either from the cluster virtual network, from a peered network, or via a configured private endpoint. These approaches require configuring a VPN, Express Route, deploying a *jumpbox* within the cluster virtual network, or creating a private endpoint inside of another virtual network. Alternatively, you can use `command invoke` to access private clusters without having to configure a VPN or Express Route. Using `command invoke` allows you to remotely invoke commands like `kubectl` and `helm` on your private cluster through the Azure API without directly connecting to the cluster. Permissions for using `command invoke` are controlled through the `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/runcommand/action` and `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedclusters/commandResults/read` roles.

## Prerequisites

* An existing private cluster.
* The Azure CLI version 2.24.0 or later.
* Access to the `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/runcommand/action` and `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedclusters/commandResults/read` roles on the cluster.

### Limitations

The pod created by the `run` command provides the following binaries:

* The latest compatible version of `kubectl` for your cluster with `kustomize`.
* `helm`

In addition, `command invoke` runs the commands from your cluster so any commands run in this manner are subject to networking and other restrictions you have configured on your cluster.

## Use `command invoke` to run a single command

Use `az aks command invoke --command` to run a command on your cluster. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks command invoke \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --command "kubectl get pods -n kube-system"
```

The above example runs the `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` command on the *myAKSCluster* cluster in *myResourceGroup*.

## Use `command invoke` to run multiple commands

Use `az aks command invoke --command` to run multiple commands on your cluster. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks command invoke \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --command "helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami && helm repo update && helm install my-release bitnami/nginx"
```

The above example runs three `helm` commands on the *myAKSCluster* cluster in *myResourceGroup*.

## Use `command invoke` to run commands an with attached file or directory

Use `az aks command invoke --command` to run commands on your cluster and `--file` to attach a file or directory for use by those commands. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks command invoke \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --command "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n default" \
  --file deployment.yaml
```

The above runs `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n default` on the *myAKSCluster* cluster in *myResourceGroup*. The `deployment.yaml` file used by that command is attached from the current directory on the development computer where `az aks command invoke` was run.

You can also attach all files in the current directory. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks command invoke \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --command "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml configmap.yaml -n default" \
  --file .
```

The above runs `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml configmap.yaml -n default` on the *myAKSCluster* cluster in *myResourceGroup*. The `deployment.yaml` and `configmap.yaml` files used by that command are part of the current directory on the development computer where `az aks command invoke` was run.
