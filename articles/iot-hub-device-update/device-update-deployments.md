# Update deployments

A deployment is how updates are delivered to one or more devices. Deployments are always associated with a device group. A deployment can be initiated from the API or the UI. 
A device group can only have one active deployment associated with it at any given time. A deployment can be scheduled to begin in the future or start immediately.

## Dynamic deployments

Deployments in Device Update for IoT Hub are dynamic in nature. Dynamic deployments empower users to move towards a set-and-forget management model by automatically deploying
updates to newly provisioned, applicable devices. Any devices that are provisioned or change their group membership after a deployment is initiated, will automatically receive
the update deployment as long as the deployment remains active without any other action on part of the user. 

## Deployment life cycle

Due to their dynamic nature, deployments remain active and in-progress until they are explicitly canceled. A deployment is considered Inactive and Superseded if a new deployment
is created targeting the same device group. A deployment can be retried for devices that might fail. Once a deployment is canceled, it cannot be reactivated again.
