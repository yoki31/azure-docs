# Device Update for Azure IoT Hub tutorial using the Ubuntu (18.04 x64) Simulator Reference Agent

Device Update for IoT Hub supports image-based, package-based and script-based updates.

Image updates provide a higher level of confidence in the end-state of the device. It is typically easier to replicate the results of an image-update between a pre-production environment and a production environment, since it doesnâ€™t pose the same challenges as packages and their dependencies. Due to their atomic nature, one can also adopt an A/B failover model easily.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to complete an end-to-end image-based update using Device Update for IoT Hub. 

In this tutorial you will learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download and install image
> * Add a tag to your IoT device
> * Import an update
> * Create a device group
> * Deploy an image update
> * Monitor the update deployment
## Prerequisites
* If you haven't already done so, create a [Device Update account and instance](create-device-update-account.md), including configuring an IoT Hub.

## Add device to Azure IoT Hub

Once the Device Update agent is running on an IoT device, the device needs to be added to the Azure IoT Hub.  From within Azure IoT Hub, a connection string will be generated for a particular device.

1. From the Azure portal, launch the Device Update IoT Hub.
2. Create a new device.
3. On the left-hand side of the page, navigate to 'IoT Devices' > Select "New".
4. Provide a name for the device under 'Device ID'--Ensure that "Autogenerate keys" is checkbox is selected.
5. Select 'Save'.
6. Now, you'll be returned to the 'Devices' page and the device you created should be in the list. Select that device.
7. In the device view, select the 'Copy' icon next to 'Primary Connection String'.
8. Paste the copied characters somewhere for later use in the steps below. **This copied string is your device connection string**.

## Install Device Update agent to test it as a simulator

1. Follow the instructions to [Install the Azure IoT Edge runtime](../iot-edge/how-to-provision-single-device-linux-symmetric.md?view=iotedge-2020-11&preserve-view=true).
   > [!NOTE]
   > The Device Update agent doesn't depend on IoT Edge. But, it does rely on the IoT Identity Service daemon that is installed with IoT Edge (1.2.0 and higher) to obtain an identity and connect to IoT Hub.
   >
   > Although not covered in this tutorial, the [IoT Identity Service daemon can be installed standalone on Linux-based IoT devices](https://azure.github.io/iot-identity-service/installation.html). The sequence of installation matters. The Device Update package agent must be installed _after_ the IoT Identity Service. Otherwise, the package agent will not be registered as an authorized component to establish a connection to IoT Hub.
1. Then, install the Device Update agent .deb packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install deviceupdate-agent deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt 
   ```
   
2. Enter your IoT device's module (or device, depending on how you [provisioned the device with Device Update](device-update-agent-provisioning.md)) primary connection string in the configuration file by running the command below.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/adu/du-config.json
   ```
   
3. Set up the agent to run as a simulator. Run following command on the IoT device so that the Device Update agent will invoke the simulator handler to process an package update with APT ('microsoft/apt:1').

   ```sh
   sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --register-content-handler /var/lib/adu/extensions/sources/libmicrosoft_simulator_1.so --update-type 'microsoft/apt:1'
   ```
   
   To register and invoke the simulator handler the command must follow the below format:
   
   sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --register--content-handler <full path to the handler file> --update-type <update type name>

4. Download the sample-du-simulator-data.json from [Release Assets](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases). Run the command below to create and edit the du-simulator-data.json in the tmp folder. 

   ```sh
   sudo nano /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   sudo chown adu:adu /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   sudo chmod 664 /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   ```
   Copy the contents from the downloaded file into the du-simulator-data.json. Press Ctrl + X to save the changes.
  
   If /tmp doesn't exist then

   ```sh
    sudo mkdir/tmp
    sudo chown root:root/tmp
    sudo chmod 1777/tmp
   ```  
   
5. Restart the Device Update agent by running the command below.

   ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart adu-agent
   ```
   
Device Update for Azure IoT Hub software is subject to the following license terms:
   * [Device Update for IoT Hub license](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
   * [Delivery optimization client license](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/LICENSE)
   
Read the license terms prior to using the agent. Your installation and use constitutes your acceptance of these terms. If you do not agree with the license terms, do not use the Device Update for IoT Hub agent.

> [!NOTE] 
> After your testing with the simulator run the below command to invoke the APT handler and [deploy over-the-air Package Updates](device-update-ubuntu-agent.md)
```sh
# sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --register-content-handler /var/lib/adu/extensions/sources/libmicrosoft_apt_1.so --update-type 'microsoft/a pt:1'
```


## Add a tag to your device

1. Log into [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the IoT Hub.

2. From 'IoT Devices' or 'IoT Edge' on the left navigation pane find your IoT device and navigate to the Device Twin or Module Twin.

3. In the Module Twin of the Device Update agent module, delete any existing Device Update tag value by setting them to null. If you are using Device identity with Device Update agent make these changes on the Device Twin.

4. Add a new Device Update tag value as shown below.

   ```JSON
       "tags": {
               "ADUGroup": "<CustomTagValue>"
               }
   ```

## Import update

1. Download the sample tutorial manifest (Tutorial Import Manifest_Sim.json) and sample update (adu-update-image-raspberrypi3-0.6.5073.1.swu) from [Release Assets](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) for the latest agent. _Note_: the update file is re-used update files from the Raspberry Pi tutorial, because the update in this tutorial will be simulated and therefore the specific file content doesn't matter. 

2. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to your IoT Hub with Device Update. Then, select the Updates option under Automatic Device Management from the left-hand navigation bar.

3. Select the Updates tab.

4. Select "+ Import New Update".

5. Select "+ Select from storage container". Select an existing account or create a new account using "+ Storage account". Then select an existing container or create a new container using "+ Container". This container will be used to stage your update files for importing.
   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend using a new container each time you import an update to avoid accidentally importing files from previous updates. If you don't use a new container, be sure to delete any files from the existing container before completing this step.
