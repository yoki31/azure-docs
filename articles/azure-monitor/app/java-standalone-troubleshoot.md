# Troubleshooting guide: Azure Monitor Application Insights for Java

In this article, we cover some of the common issues that you might face while instrumenting a Java application by using the Java agent for Application Insights. We also cover the steps to resolve these issues. Application Insights is a feature of the Azure Monitor platform service.

## Check the self-diagnostic log file

By default, Application Insights Java 3.x produces a log file named `applicationinsights.log` in the same directory that holds the `applicationinsights-agent-3.2.2.jar` file.

This log file is the first place to check for hints to any issues you might be experiencing.

## JVM fails to start

If the JVM fails to start with "Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing",
try re-downloading the agent jar file because it may have been corrupted during file transfer.

## Upgrade from the Application Insights Java 2.x SDK

If you're already using the Application Insights Java 2.x SDK in your application, you can keep using it.
The Application Insights Java 3.x agent will detect it,
and capture and correlate any custom telemetry you're sending via the 2.x SDK,
while suppressing any auto-collection performed by the 2.x SDK to prevent duplicate telemetry.
For more information, see [Upgrade from the Java 2.x SDK](./java-standalone-upgrade-from-2x.md).

## Upgrade from Application Insights Java 3.0 Preview

If you're upgrading from the Java 3.0 Preview agent, review all of the [configuration options](./java-standalone-config.md) carefully. The JSON structure has completely changed in the 3.0 general availability (GA) release.

These changes include:

-  The configuration file name has changed from `ApplicationInsights.json` to `applicationinsights.json`.
-  The `instrumentationSettings` node is no longer present. All content in `instrumentationSettings` is moved to the root level. 
-  Configuration nodes like `sampling`, `jmxMetrics`, `instrumentation`, and `heartbeat` are moved out of `preview` to the root level.

## Some logging is not auto-collected

Logging is only captured if it first meets the level that is configured for the logging framework,
and second, also meets the level that is configured for Application Insights.

For example, if your logging framework is configured to log `WARN` (and above) from package `com.example`,
and Application Insights is configured to capture `INFO` (and above),
then Application Insights will only capture `WARN` (and above) from package `com.example`.

The best way to know if a particular logging statement meets the logging frameworks' configured threshold
is to confirm that it is showing up in your normal application log (e.g. file or console).

Also note that if an exception object is passed to the logger, then the log message (and exception object details)
will show up in the Azure portal under the `exceptions` table instead of the `traces` table.

See the [auto-collected logging configuration](./java-standalone-config.md#auto-collected-logging) for more details.

## Import SSL certificates

This section helps you to troubleshoot and possibly fix the exceptions related to SSL certificates when using the Java agent.

There are two different paths below for resolving this issue:
* If using a default Java keystore
* If using a custom Java keystore

If you aren't sure which path to follow, check to see if you have a JVM arg `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=...`.
If you _don't_ have such a JVM arg, then you are probably using the default Java keystore.
If you _do_ have such a JVM arg, then you are probably using a custom keystore,
and the JVM arg will point you to your custom keystore.

### If using the default Java keystore:

Typically the default Java keystore will already have all of the CA root certificates. However there might be some exceptions, such as the ingestion endpoint certificate might be signed by a different root certificate. So we recommend the following three steps to resolve this issue:

1.	Check if the SSL certificate that was used to sign the Application Insights endpoint is already present in the default keystore. The trusted CA certificates, by default, are stored in `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`. To list certificates in a Java keystore use the following command:
    > `keytool -list -v -keystore $PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE`
 
    You can redirect the output to a temp file like this (will be easy to search later)
    > `keytool -list -v -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts > temp.txt`

2. Once you have the list of certificates, follow these [steps](#steps-to-download-ssl-certificate) to download the SSL certificate that was used to sign the Application Insights endpoint.

    Once you have the certificate downloaded, generate an SHA-1 hash on the certificate using the below command:
    > `keytool -printcert -v -file "your_downloaded_ssl_certificate.cer"`
 
    Copy the SHA-1 value and check if this value is present in "temp.txt" file you saved previously.  If you are not able to find the SHA-1 value in the temp file, it indicates that the downloaded SSL cert is missing in default Java keystore.


3. Import the SSL certificate to the default Java keystore using the following command:
    >   `keytool -import -file "the cert file" -alias "some meaningful name" -keystore "path to cacerts file"`
 
    In this case it will be
 
    > `keytool -import -file "your downloaded ssl cert file" -alias "some meaningful name" $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`


### If using a custom Java keystore:

If you are using a custom Java keystore, you may need to import the Application Insights endpoint(s) SSL certificate(s) into it.
We recommend the following two steps to resolve this issue:
1. Follow these [steps](#steps-to-download-ssl-certificate) to download the SSL certificate from the Application Insights endpoint.
2. Use the following command to import the SSL certificate to the custom Java keystore:
    > `keytool -importcert -alias your_ssl_certificate -file "your downloaded SSL certificate name.cer" -keystore "Your KeyStore name" -storepass "Your keystore password" -noprompt`

### Steps to download SSL certificate

1.	Open your favorite browser and go to the URL from which you want to download the SSL certificate.

2.	Select the **View site information** (lock) icon in the browser, and then select the **Certificate** option.

3.  Later, you have to click on the "Certificate Path" -> Select the root Certificate -> Click on 'View Certificate'. This will pop up a new certificate menu and you can download the certificate, from the new menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/java-ipa/troubleshooting/root-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to select the root certificate." lightbox="media/java-ipa/troubleshooting/root-certificate.png":::

4.	Go to the **Details** tab and select **Copy to file**.
5.	Select the **Next** button, select **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** format, and then select **Next** again.

6.	Specify the file where you want to save the SSL certificate. Then select **Next** > **Finish**. You should see a "The export was successful" message.

> [!WARNING]
> You'll need to repeat these steps to get the new certificate before the current certificate expires. You can find the expiration information on the **Details** tab of the **Certificate** dialog box.

## Understanding UnknownHostException

If you see this exception after upgrading to Java agent version greater than 3.2.0, upgrading your network to resolve the new endpoint shown in the exception might resolve the exception. The reason for the difference between Application Insights versions is that versions greater than 3.2.0 point to the new ingestion endpoint `v2.1/track` compared to the older `v2/track`. The new ingestion endpoint automatically redirects you to the ingestion endpoint (new endpoint shown in exception) nearest to the storage for your Application Insights resource.

## Missing cipher suites

If the Application Insights Java agent detects that you do not have any of the cipher suites that are supported by the endpoints it connects to, it will alert you and link you here.

### Background on cipher suites: 
Cipher suites come into play before a client application and server exchange information over an SSL/TLS connection. The client application initiates an SSL handshake. Part of that process involves notifying the server which cipher suites it supports. The server receives that information and compares the cipher suites supported by the client application with the algorithms it supports. If it finds a match, the server notifies the client application and a secure connection is established. If it does not find a match, the server refuses the connection.

#### How to determine client side cipher suites:
In this case, the client is the JVM on which your instrumented application is running. Starting from 3.2.5, Application Insights Java will log a warning message if missing cipher suites could be causing connection failures to one of the service endpoints.

If using an earlier version of Application Insights Java, compile and run the following Java program to get the list of supported cipher suites in your JVM:

```
import javax.net.ssl.SSLServerSocketFactory;

public class Ciphers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SSLServerSocketFactory ssf = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
        String[] defaultCiphers = ssf.getDefaultCipherSuites();
        System.out.println("Default\tCipher");
        for (int i = 0; i < defaultCiphers.length; ++i) {
            System.out.print('*');
            System.out.print('\t');
            System.out.println(defaultCiphers[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
Following are the cipher suites that are generally supported by the Application Insights endpoints:
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256

#### How to determine server side cipher suites:
In this case, the server side is the Application Insights ingestion endpoint or the Application Insights Live metrics endpoint. You can use an online tool like [SSLLABS](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) to determine the expected cipher suites based on the endpoint url.

#### How to add the missing cipher suites:

If using Java 9 or later, please check if the JVM has `jdk.crypto.cryptoki` module included in the jmods folder. Also if you are building a custom java runtime using `jlink` please make sure to include the same module.
