# Application Monitoring for Azure App Service and Node.js

Monitoring of your Node.js web applications running on [Azure App Services](../../app-service/index.yml) does not require any modifications to the code. This article will walk you through enabling Azure Monitor Application Insights monitoring as well as provide preliminary guidance for automating the process for large-scale deployments.

## Enable Application Insights

The easiest way to enable application monitoring for Node.js applications running on Azure App Services is through Azure portal.
Turning on application monitoring in Azure portal will automatically instrument your application with Application Insights, and doesn't require any code changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If both agent-based monitoring and manual SDK-based instrumentation is detected, only the manual instrumentation settings will be honored. This is to prevent duplicate data from being sent. To learn more about this, check out the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.

### Auto-instrumentation through Azure portal

You can turn on monitoring for your Node.js apps running in Azure App Service just with one click, no code change required.
Application Insights for Node.js is integrated with Azure App Service on Linux - both code-based and custom containers, and with App Service on Windows for code-based apps.
The integration is in public preview. The integration adds Node.js SDK, which is in GA.

1. **Select Application Insights** in the Azure control panel for your app service, then select **Enable**.

2. Choose to create a new resource, or select an existing Application Insights resource for this application.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you select **OK** to create the new resource you will be prompted to **Apply monitoring settings**. Selecting **Continue** will link your new Application Insights resource to your app service, doing so will also **trigger a restart of your app service**.

3. Once you have specified which resource to use, you are all set to go.

## Enable client-side monitoring

To enable client-side monitoring for your Node.js application, you need to [manually add the client-side JavaScript SDK to your application](./javascript.md).

## Automate monitoring

In order to enable telemetry collection with Application Insights, only the following Application settings need to be set:

### Application settings definitions

| App setting name | Definition | Value |
|------------------|------------|------:|
| ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION | Main extension, which controls runtime monitoring. | `~2` in Windows or `~3` in Linux. |
| XDT_MicrosoftApplicationInsights_NodeJS | Flag to control if node.js agent is included. | 0 or 1 (only applicable in Windows). |

> [!NOTE]
> Profiler and snapshot debugger are not available for Node.js applications

## Troubleshooting

Below is our step-by-step troubleshooting guide for extension/agent based monitoring for Node.js based applications running on Azure App Services.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

1. Check that `ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION` app setting is set to a value of "~2".
2. Browse to `https://yoursitename.scm.azurewebsites.net/ApplicationInsights`.  

    :::image type="content"source="./media/azure-web-apps/app-insights-sdk-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the link above results page."border ="false"::: 

    - Confirm that the `Application Insights Extension Status` is `Pre-Installed Site Extension, version 2.8.x.xxxx, is running.` 

         If it is not running, follow the [enable Application Insights monitoring instructions](#enable-application-insights).

    - Navigate to *D:\local\Temp\status.json* and open *status.json*.

    Confirm that `SDKPresent` is set to false, `AgentInitializedSuccessfully` to true and `IKey` to have a valid iKey.

    Below is an example of the JSON file:

    ```json
        "AppType":"node.js",
                
        "MachineName":"c89d3a6d0357",
                
        "PID":"47",
                
        "AgentInitializedSuccessfully":true,
                
        "SDKPresent":false,
                
        "IKey":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
                
        "SdkVersion":"1.8.10"
    
    ```

    If `SDKPresent` is true this indicates that the extension detected that some aspect of the SDK is already present in the Application, and will back-off.


# [Linux](#tab/linux)

1. Check that `ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION` app setting is set to a value of "~3".
2. Navigate to */var/log/applicationinsights/* and open *status.json*.

    Confirm that `SDKPresent` is set to false, `AgentInitializedSuccessfully` to true and `IKey` to have a valid iKey.

    Below is an example of the JSON file:

    ```json
        "AppType":"node.js",
                
        "MachineName":"c89d3a6d0357",
                
        "PID":"47",
                
        "AgentInitializedSuccessfully":true,
                
        "SDKPresent":false,
                
        "IKey":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
                
        "SdkVersion":"1.8.10"
    
    ```

    If `SDKPresent` is true this indicates that the extension detected that some aspect of the SDK is already present in the Application, and will back-off.
