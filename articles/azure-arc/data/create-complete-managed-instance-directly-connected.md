# Quickstart: Deploy Azure Arc-enable data services - directly connected mode - Azure portal

This article demonstrates how to deploy Azure Arc-enabled data services in directly connected mode from the Azure portal.

To deploy in indirectly connected mode, see [Quickstart: Deploy Azure Arc-enable data services - indirectly connected mode - Azure CLI](create-complete-managed-instance-indirectly-connected.md).

When you complete the steps in this article, you will have:

- An Arc-enabled Azure Kubernetes cluster.
- A data controller in directly connected mode.
- An instance of Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance.
- A connection to the instance with Azure Data Studio.

Azure Arc allows you to run Azure data services on-premises, at the edge, and in public clouds via Kubernetes. Deploy SQL Managed Instance and PostgreSQL Hyperscale data services (preview) with Azure Arc. The benefits of using Azure Arc include staying current with constant service patches, elastic scale, self-service provisioning, unified management, and support for disconnected mode.  

## Install client tools

First, install the [client tools](install-client-tools.md) needed on your machine. To complete the steps in this article, you will use the following tools:
* Azure Data Studio
* The Azure Arc extension for Azure Data Studio
* Kubernetes CLI
* Azure CLI 
* `arcdata` extension for Azure CLI.

In addition, you need the following additional extensions to connect the cluster to Azure:

* connectedk8s
* k8s-extension


## Access your Kubernetes cluster

After installing the client tools, you need access to a Kubernetes cluster. You can create  Kubernetes cluster with [`az aks create`](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_create), or you can follow the steps below to create the cluster in the Azure portal.  

### Create a cluster

To quickly create a Kubernetes cluster, use Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).

1. Log in to [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com).
1. In the search resources field at the top of the portal, type **Kubernetes**, and select **Kubernetes services**.
   Azure takes you to Kubernetes services.
1. Select **Create** > **Create Kubernetes cluster**.
1. Under **Basics**,
    1. Specify your **Subscription**.
    1. Create a resource group, or specify an existing resource group.
    1. Specify a cluster name
    1. Specify a region
    1. Under **Availability zones**, remove all selected zones. You should not specify any zones.
    1. Verify the Kubernetes version. For minimum supported version, see [Plan an Azure Arc-enabled data services deployment](plan-azure-arc-data-services.md).
    1. Under **Node size**, select a node size for your cluster based on the [Sizing guidance](sizing-guidance.md).
    1. For **Scale method**, select **Manual**.
1. Click **Review + create**.
1. Click **Create**.

Azure creates your Kubernetes cluster.

When the cluster is completed, the Azure updates the portal to show the completed status:

:::image type="content" source="media/create-complete-managed-instance-directly-connected/create-aks-complete.png" alt-text="Your deployment is complete":::

### Connect to the cluster

After creating the cluster, connect to the cluster through the Azure CLI.

1. Log in to Azure - if not already.

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

   Follow the steps to connect. 

1. Get the credentials to connect to the cluster.

   The scripts in this article use angle brackets `< ... >` to identify values you will need to replace before you run the scripts. Do not include the angle brackets.

   ```azurecli
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <cluster_name>
   ```

   Use the resource group and cluster name that you defined when you created the cluster in the portal.

   Azure CLI returns the following output.

   ```output
   Merged "<cluster name>" as current context in C:<current path>\.kube\config
   ```

1. Confirm that your cluster is running. Use the following command: 

   ```azurecli
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   The command returns a list of the running nodes.

   ```output
   NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
   aks-agentpool-37241625-vmss000000   Ready    agent   3h10m   v1.20.9
   aks-agentpool-37241625-vmss000001   Ready    agent   3h10m   v1.20.9
   aks-agentpool-37241625-vmss000002   Ready    agent   3h9m    v1.20.9
   ```

### Arc enable the Kubernetes cluster

Now that the cluster is running, connect the cluster to Azure. When you connect a cluster to Azure, you Arc enable it. Arc enabling your cluster allow you to view and manage the cluster, and deploy and manage additional services such as Arc-enabled data services on the cluster directly from Azure portal. 

Use `az connectedk8s connect` to connect the cluster to Azure: 

```azurecli
az connectedk8s connect --resource-group <resource group> --name <cluster name> 
```

After the connect command completes successfully, you can view the shadow object in the Azure portal. The shadow object is the representation of the Azure Arc-enabled cluster. 

1. In the Azure portal, locate the resource group. One way to find the resource group is to type the resource group name in search on the portal. The portal displays a link to the resource group below the search box. Click the resource group link.
1. In the resource group, under **Overview** you can see the Kubernetes cluster, and the shadow object. See the following image:

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-complete-managed-instance-directly-connected/azure-arc-resources.png" alt-text="The Kubernetes - Azure Arc item item type is the shadow resource." lightbox="media/create-complete-managed-instance-directly-connected/azure-arc-resources-expanded.png":::

   The shadow resource is the resource type **Kubernetes - Azure Arc** in the image above. The other resource is the **Kubernetes service** cluster. Both resources have the same name. 

## Create the data controller

The next step is to create the data controller in directly connected mode via the Azure portal. Use the same subscription and resource group that you used to [create a cluster](#create-a-cluster).

1. In the portal, locate the resource group from the previous step.
1. Select the **Kubernetes - Azure Arc** object name.
1. Select **Settings** > **Extensions**. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Azure Arc data controller**.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Specify a name for the data controller.
1. Specify a custom location (namespace). 

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-complete-managed-instance-directly-connected/custom-location.png" alt-text="Create a new custom location and specify a namespace.":::

1. For **Kubernetes configuration template**, specify *azure-arc-aks-premium-storage* because this example uses an AKS cluster. 
2. For **Service type**, select **Load balancer**.
3. Set a user name and password for the metrics and log services. 

   The passwords must be at least eight characters long and contain characters from three of the following four categories: Latin uppercase letters, Latin lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.

Follow the instructions in the portal to complete the specification and deploy the data controller.

To view data controllers, run following command: 

```console
kubectl get datacontrollers -A
```

### Monitor deployment

You can also monitor the creation of the data controller with the following command: 

```console
kubectl get datacontroller --namespace <namespace>
```

The command returns the state of the data controller. For example, the following results indicate that the deployment is in progress:

```output
NAME          STATE
<namespace>   DeployingMonitoring
```

Once the state of the data controller is ‘READY’, then this step is completed. For example:

```output
NAME          STATE
<namespace>   Ready
```

## Create Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance 

1. In the portal, locate the resource group.
1. In the resource group, select **Create**.
1. Enter *managed instance*. The Azure portal returns resource types with a matching name.
1. Select **Azure SQL Managed Instance - Azure Arc**.
1. Click **Create**. 
1. Specify your resource group, and custom location. Use the same value that you set in the [previous step](#create-a-cluster).
1. Set the **LoadBalancer** service type. 
1. Provide credentials (login and password) for the managed instance administrator account. 
1. Click **Review and Create**.
1. Click **Create**. 

Azure creates the managed instance on the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. 

To know when the instance has been created, run:

```console
kubectl get sqlmi -n <namespace>
```

Once the state of the managed instance namespace is ‘READY’, then this step is completed. For example:

```output
NAME          STATE
<namespace>   Ready
```


## Connect with Azure Data Studio

To connect with Azure Data Studio, see [Connect to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance](connect-managed-instance.md).
