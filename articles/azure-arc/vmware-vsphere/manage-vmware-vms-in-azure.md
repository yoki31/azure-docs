# Manage VMware VMs in Azure through Arc-enabled VMware vSphere

In this article, you will learn how to perform various operations on the Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere (preview) VMs such as:

- Start, stop, and restart a VM

- Control access and add Azure tags

- Add, remove, and update network interfaces

- Add, remove, and update disks and update VM size (CPU cores, memory)

- Enable guest management

- Install extensions (enabling guest management is required)

To perform guest OS operations on Arc-enabled VMs, you must enable guest management on the VMs. When you enable guest management, the Arc Connected Machine Agent is installed on the VM.

## Enable guest management

Before you can install an extension, you must enable guest management on the VMware VM.  

1. Make sure your target machine:

   - is running a [supported operating system](../servers/agent-overview.md#supported-operating-systems).

   - is able to connect through the firewall to communicate over the internet and these [URLs](../servers/agent-overview.md#networking-configuration) are not blocked.

   - has VMware tools installed and running.

   - is powered on and the resource bridge has network connectivity to the host running the VM.

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you're using a Linux VM, the account must not prompt for login on sudo commands. To override the prompt, from a terminal, run `sudo visudo` and add `<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to the end of the file.  Make sure to replace `<username>`.
   >
   >If your VM template has these changes incorporated, you won't need to do this for the VM created from that template.

1. From your browser, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Search for and select the VMware VM and select **Configuration**.

3. Select **Enable guest management** and provide the administrator username and password to enable guest management.  Then select **Apply**.

   For Linux, use the root account, and for Windows, use an account that is a member of the Local Administrators group.

## Install the LogAnalytics extension

1. From your browser, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select the VMware VM that you want to install extension.

1. Navigate to **Extensions** and select **Add**.

1. Select the extension you want to install. Based on the extension, you'll need to provide configuration details, such as the workspace ID and primary key for Log Analytics extension. Then select **Review + create**.

The deployment starts the installation of the extension on the selected VM.

## Delete a VM

If you no longer need the VM, you can delete it.

1. From your browser, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Search for and select the VM you want to delete.

3. In the single VM view, select on **Delete**.

4. When prompted, confirm that you want to delete it.

>[!NOTE]
>This also deletes the VM in your VMware vCenter.
