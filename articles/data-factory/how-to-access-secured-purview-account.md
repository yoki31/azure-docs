# Access a secured Azure Purview account from Azure Data Factory

This article describes how to access a secured Azure Purview account from Azure Data Factory for different integration scenarios.

## Azure Purview private endpoint deployment scenarios

You can use [Azure private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) for your Azure Purview accounts to allow secure access from a virtual network (VNet) to the catalog over a Private Link. Azure Purview provides different types of private points for various access need: *account* private endpoint, *portal* private endpoint, and *ingestion* private endpoints. Learn more from [Azure Purview private endpoints conceptual overview](../purview/catalog-private-link.md#conceptual-overview). 

If your Azure Purview account is protected by firewall and denies public access, make sure you follow below checklist to set up the private endpoints so Data Factory can successfully connect to Azure Purview. 

| Scenario                                                     | Required Azure Purview private endpoints                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Run pipeline and report lineage to Azure Purview](tutorial-push-lineage-to-purview.md) | For Data Factory pipeline to push lineage to Azure Purview, Azure Purview ***account*** and ***ingestion*** private endpoints are required. <br>- When using **Azure Integration Runtime**, follow the steps in [Managed private endpoints for Azure Purview](#managed-private-endpoints-for-azure-purview) section to create managed private endpoints in the Data Factory managed virtual network.<br>- When using **Self-hosted Integration Runtime**, follow the steps in [this section](../purview/catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md#option-2---enable-account-portal-and-ingestion-private-endpoint-on-existing-azure-purview-accounts) to create the *account* and *ingestion* private endpoints in your integration runtime's virtual network. |
| [Discover and explore data using Azure Purview on ADF UI](how-to-discover-explore-purview-data.md) | To use the search bar at the top center of Data Factory authoring UI to search for Azure Purview data and perform actions, you need to create Azure Purview ***account*** and ***portal*** private endpoints in the virtual network that you launch the Data Factory Studio. Follow the steps in [Enable *account* and *portal* private endpoint](../purview/catalog-private-link-account-portal.md#option-2---enable-account-and-portal-private-endpoint-on-existing-azure-purview-accounts). |

## Managed private endpoints for Azure Purview

[Managed private endpoints](managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint.md#managed-private-endpoints) are private endpoints created in the Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network establishing a private link to Azure resources. When you run pipeline and report lineage to a firewall protected Azure Purview account, create an Azure Integration Runtime with "Virtual network configuration" option enabled, then create the Azure Purview ***account*** and ***ingestion*** managed private endpoints as follows.

### Create managed private endpoints

To create managed private endpoints for Azure Purview on Data Factory authoring UI:

1. Go to **Manage** -> **Azure Purview**, and click **Edit** to edit your existing connected Azure Purview account or click **Connect to an Azure Purview account** to connect to a new Azure Purview account.

2. Select **Yes** for **Create managed private endpoints**. You need to have at least one Azure Integration Runtime with "Virtual network configuration" option enabled in the data factory to see this option.

3. Click **+ Create all** button to batch create the needed Azure Purview private endpoints, including the ***account*** private endpoint and the ***ingestion*** private endpoints for the Azure Purview managed resources - Blob storage, Queue storage, and Event Hubs namespace. You need to have at least **Reader** role on your Azure Purview account for Data Factory to retrieve the Azure Purview managed resources' information.

4. In the next page, specify a name for the private endpoint. It will be used to generate names for the ingestion private endpoints as well with suffix.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-access-secured-purview-account/name-purview-private-endpoints.png" alt-text="Name the managed private endpoints for your connected Azure Purview account.":::

5. Click **Create** to create the private endpoints. After creation, 4 private endpoint requests will be generated that must [get approved by an owner of Azure Purview](#approve-private-endpoint-connections).

Such batch managed private endpoint creation is provided on the Azure Purview UI only. If you want to create the managed private endpoints programmatically, you need to create those PEs individually. You can find Azure Purview managed resources' information from Azure portal -> your Azure Purview account -> Managed resources.

### Approve private endpoint connections

After you create the managed private endpoints for Azure Purview, you see "Pending" state first. The Azure Purview owner need to approve the private endpoint connections for each resource.

If you have permission to approve the Azure Purview private endpoint connection, from Data Factory UI: 

1. Go to **Manage** -> **Azure Purview** -> **Edit**
2. In the private endpoint list, click the **Edit** (pencil) button next to each private endpoint name
3. Click **Manage approvals in Azure portal** which will bring you to the resource.
4. On the given resource, go to **Networking** -> **Private endpoint connection** to approve it. The private endpoint is named as `data_factory_name.your_defined_private_endpoint_name` with description as "Requested by data_factory_name".
5. Repeat this operation for all private endpoints.

If you don't have permission to approve the Azure Purview private endpoint connection, ask the Azure Purview account owner to do as follows.

- For *account* private endpoint, go to Azure portal -> your Azure Purview account -> Networking -> Private endpoint connection to approve.
- For *ingestion* private endpoints, go to Azure portal -> your Azure Purview account -> Managed resources, click into the Storage account and Event Hubs namespace respectively, and approve the private endpoint connection in Networking -> Private endpoint connection page.

### Monitor managed private endpoints

You can monitor the created managed private endpoints for Azure Purview at two places:

- Go to **Manage** -> **Azure Purview** -> **Edit** to open your existing connected Azure Purview account. To see all the relevant private endpoints, you need to have at least **Reader** role on your Azure Purview account for Data Factory to retrieve the Azure Purview managed resources' information. Otherwise, you only see *account* private endpoint with warning.
- Go to **Manage** -> **Managed private endpoints** where you see all the managed private endpoints created under the data factory. If you have at least **Reader** role on your Azure Purview account, you see Azure Purview relevant private endpoints being grouped together. Otherwise, they show up separately in the list.
