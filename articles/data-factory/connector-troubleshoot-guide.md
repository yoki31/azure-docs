## General copy activity errors

The errors below are general to the copy activity and could occur with any connector.

### Error code: JreNotFound

- **Message**: `Java Runtime Environment cannot be found on the Self-hosted Integration Runtime machine. It is required for parsing or writing to Parquet/ORC files. Make sure Java Runtime Environment has been installed on the Self-hosted Integration Runtime machine.`

- **Cause**: The self-hosted IR can't find Java Runtime. Java Runtime is required for reading particular sources.

- **Recommendation**:  Check your integration runtime environment, see [Use Self-hosted Integration Runtime](./format-parquet.md#using-self-hosted-integration-runtime).


### Error code: WildcardPathSinkNotSupported

- **Message**: `Wildcard in path is not supported in sink dataset. Fix the path: '%setting;'.`

- **Cause**: The sink dataset doesn't support wildcard values.

- **Recommendation**:  Check the sink dataset, and rewrite the path without using a wildcard value.


### FIPS issue

- **Symptoms**: Copy activity fails on a FIPS-enabled self-hosted IR machine with the following error message: `This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.` 

- **Cause**: This error might occur when you copy data with connectors such as Azure Blob, SFTP, and so on. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) defines a certain set of cryptographic algorithms that are allowed to be used. When FIPS mode is enabled on the machine, some cryptographic classes that copy activity depends on are blocked in some scenarios.

- **Resolution**: Learn [why we’re not recommending “FIPS Mode” anymore](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/why-we-8217-re-not-recommending-8220-fips-mode-8221-anymore/ba-p/701037), and evaluate whether you can disable FIPS on your self-hosted IR machine.

    Alternatively, if you only want to bypass FIPS and make the activity runs succeed, do the following:

    1. Open the folder where Self-hosted IR is installed. The path is usually *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Integration Runtime \<IR version>\Shared*.

    2. Open the *diawp.exe.config* file and then, at the end of the `<runtime>` section, add `<enforceFIPSPolicy enabled="false"/>`, as shown here:

        :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-troubleshoot-guide/disable-fips-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a section of the diawp.exe.config file showing FIPS disabled.":::

    3. Save the file, and then restart the Self-hosted IR machine.

### Error code: JniException

- **Message**: `An error occurred when invoking Java Native Interface.`

- **Cause**: If the error message contains "Cannot create JVM: JNI return code [-6][JNI call failed: Invalid arguments.]", the possible cause is that JVM can't be created because some illegal (global) arguments are set.

- **Recommendation**: Log in to the machine that hosts *each node* of your self-hosted integration runtime. Check to ensure that the system variable is set correctly, as follows: `_JAVA_OPTIONS "-Xms256m -Xmx16g" with memory bigger than 8G`. Restart all the integration runtime nodes, and then rerun the pipeline.

### Error code: GetOAuth2AccessTokenErrorResponse

- **Message**: `Failed to get access token from your token endpoint. Error returned from your authorization server: %errorResponse;.`

- **Cause**: Your client ID or client secret is invalid, and the authentication failed in your authorization server.

- **Recommendation**: Correct all OAuth2 client credential flow settings of your authorization server.

### Error code: FailedToGetOAuth2AccessToken

- **Message**: `Failed to get access token from your token endpoint. Error message: %errorMessage;.`

- **Cause**: OAuth2 client credential flow settings are invalid.

- **Recommendation**: Correct all OAuth2 client credential flow settings of your authorization server.

### Error code: OAuth2AccessTokenTypeNotSupported

- **Message**: `The toke type '%tokenType;' from your authorization server is not supported, supported types: '%tokenTypes;'.`

- **Cause**: Your authorization server is not supported.

- **Recommendation**: Use an authorization server that can return tokens with supported token types.

### Error code: OAuth2ClientIdColonNotAllowed

- **Message**: `The character colon(:) is not allowed in clientId for OAuth2ClientCredential authentication.`

- **Cause**: Your client ID includes the invalid character colon (`:`).

- **Recommendation**: Use a valid client ID.

### Error code: ManagedIdentityCredentialObjectNotSupported

- **Message**: `Managed identity credential is not supported in this version ('%version;') of Self Hosted Integration Runtime.`

- **Recommendation**: Check the supported version and upgrade the integration runtime to a higher version.

### Error code: QueryMissingFormatSettingsInDataset

- **Message**: `The format settings are missing in dataset %dataSetName;.`

- **Cause**: The dataset type is Binary, which is not supported.

- **Recommendation**: Use the DelimitedText, Json, Avro, Orc, or Parquet dataset instead.

- **Cause**: For the file storage, the format settings are missing in the dataset.

- **Recommendation**: Deselect the "Binary copy" in the dataset, and set correct format settings.

### Error code: QueryUnsupportedCommandBehavior

- **Message**: `The command behavior "%behavior;" is not supported.`

- **Recommendation**: Don't add the command behavior as a parameter for preview or GetSchema API request URL.

### Error code: DataConsistencyFailedToGetSourceFileMetadata

- **Message**: `Failed to retrieve source file ('%name;') metadata to validate data consistency.`

- **Cause**: There is a transient issue on the sink data store, or retrieving metadata from the sink data store is not allowed.

### Error code: DataConsistencyFailedToGetSinkFileMetadata

- **Message**: `Failed to retrieve sink file ('%name;') metadata to validate data consistency.`

- **Cause**: There is a transient issue on the sink data store, or retrieving metadata from the sink data store is not allowed.

### Error code: DataConsistencyValidationNotSupportedForNonDirectBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `Data consistency validation is not supported in current copy activity settings.`

- **Cause**: The data consistency validation is only supported in the direct binary copy scenario.

- **Recommendation**: Remove the 'validateDataConsistency' property in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: DataConsistencyValidationNotSupportedForLowVersionSelfHostedIntegrationRuntime

- **Message**: `'validateDataConsistency' is not supported in this version ('%version;') of Self Hosted Integration Runtime.`

- **Recommendation**: Check the supported integration runtime version and upgrade it to a higher version, or remove the 'validateDataConsistency' property from copy activities.

### Error code: SkipMissingFileNotSupportedForNonDirectBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `Skip missing file is not supported in current copy activity settings, it's only supported with direct binary copy with folder.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'fileMissing' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipInconsistencyDataNotSupportedForNonDirectBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `Skip inconsistency is not supported in current copy activity settings, it's only supported with direct binary copy when validateDataConsistency is true.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'dataInconsistency' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipForbiddenFileNotSupportedForNonDirectBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `Skip forbidden file is not supported in current copy activity settings, it's only supported with direct binary copy with folder.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'fileForbidden' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipForbiddenFileNotSupportedForThisConnector

- **Message**: `Skip forbidden file is not supported for this connector: ('%connectorName;').`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'fileForbidden' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipInvalidFileNameNotSupportedForNonDirectBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `Skip invalid file name is not supported in current copy activity settings, it's only supported with direct binary copy with folder.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'invalidFileName' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipInvalidFileNameNotSupportedForSource

- **Message**: `Skip invalid file name is not supported for '%connectorName;' source.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'invalidFileName' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipInvalidFileNameNotSupportedForSink

- **Message**: `Skip invalid file name is not supported for '%connectorName;' sink.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'invalidFileName' of the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: SkipAllErrorFileNotSupportedForNonBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `Skip all error file is not supported in current copy activity settings, it's only supported with binary copy with folder.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove 'allErrorFile' in the skipErrorFile setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: DeleteFilesAfterCompletionNotSupportedForNonDirectBinaryCopy

- **Message**: `'deleteFilesAfterCompletion' is not support in current copy activity settings, it's only supported with direct binary copy.`

- **Recommendation**: Remove the 'deleteFilesAfterCompletion' setting or use direct binary copy.

### Error code: DeleteFilesAfterCompletionNotSupportedForThisConnector

- **Message**: `'deleteFilesAfterCompletion' is not supported for this connector: ('%connectorName;').`

- **Recommendation**: Remove the 'deleteFilesAfterCompletion' setting in the copy activity payload.

### Error code: FailedToDownloadCustomPlugins
