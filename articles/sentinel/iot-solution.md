## Visualize and monitor Defender for IoT data

To visualize and monitor your Defender for IoT data, use the workbooks deployed to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace as part of the [IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT](#install-the-defender-for-iot-solution) solution.

The Defender for IoT workbooks provide guided investigations for OT entities based on open incidents, alert notifications, and activities for OT assets. They also provide a hunting experience across the MITRE ATT&CK® framework for ICS, and are designed to enable analysts, security engineers, and MSSPs to gain situational awareness of OT security posture.

View workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel on the **Threat management > Workbooks > My workbooks** tab. For more information, see [Visualize collected data](get-visibility.md).

The following table describes the workbooks included in the **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution:

|Workbook  |Description  |Logs  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Alerts**     |  Displays data such as: Alert Metrics, Topmost Alerts, Alert over time, Alert by Severity, Alert by Engine, Alert by Device Type, Alert by Vendor and Alert by IP address.         |    Uses data from the following log: SecurityAlert     |
|**Incidents**     |   Displays data such as: <br><br>- Incident Metrics, Topmost Incident, Incident over time, Incident by Protocol, Incident by Device Type, Incident by Vendor, and Incident by IP address.<br><br>- Incident by Severity, Incident Mean time to respond, Incident Mean time to resolve and Incident close reasons.       |   Uses data from the following log: SecurityAlert       |
|**MITRE ATT&CK® for ICS**     |   Displays data such as: Tactic Count, Tactic Details, Tactic over time, Technique Count.        |   Uses data from the following log: SecurityAlert       |
|**Device Inventory**     | Displays data such as: OT device name, type, IP address, Mac address, Model, OS, Serial Number, Vendor, Protocols.         |    Uses data from the following log: SecurityAlert      |
|     |         |         |

## Automate response to Defender for IoT alerts

Playbooks are collections of automated remediation actions that can be run from Microsoft Sentinel as a routine. A playbook can help automate and orchestrate your threat response; it can be run manually or set to run automatically in response to specific alerts or incidents, when triggered by an analytics rule or an automation rule, respectively.

The playbooks described in the following sections are deployed to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace as part of the [IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT](#install-the-defender-for-iot-solution) solution.

For more information, see:

- [Tutorial: Use playbooks with automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md)
- [Automate threat response with playbooks in Microsoft Sentinel](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md)

###  Automatically close incidents

**Playbook name**: AD4IoT-AutoCloseIncidents

In some cases, maintenance activities generate alerts in Microsoft Sentinel that can distract a SOC team from handling the real problems. This playbook automatically closes incidents created from such alerts during a specified maintenance period, explicitly parsing the IoT device entity fields.

To use this playbook:

- Enter the relevant time period when the maintenance is expected to occur, and the IP addresses of any relevant assets, such as listed in an Excel file.
- Create a watchlist that includes al the asset IP addresses on which alerts should be handled automatically.


### Email notifications by production line

**Playbook name**: AD4IoT-MailByProductionLine

This playbook sends mail to notify specific stakeholders about alerts and events that occur in your environment.

For example, when you have specific security teams assigned to specific product lines or geographic locations, you'll want that team to be notified about alerts that are relevant to their responsibilities.

To use this playbook, create a watchlist that maps between the sensor names and the mailing addresses of each of the stakeholders you want to alert.

### Create a new ServiceNow ticket

**Playbook name** AD4IoT-NewAssetServiceNowTicket

Typically, the entity authorized to program a PLC is the Engineering Workstation. Therefore, attackers might create new Engineering Workstations in order to create malicious PLC programming.

This playbook opens a ticket in SerivceNow each time a new Engineering Workstation is detected, explicitly parsing the IoT device entity fields.
