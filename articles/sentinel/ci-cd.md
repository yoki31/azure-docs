# Deploy custom content from your repository (Public preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Microsoft Sentinel **Repositories** page is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Microsoft Sentinel *content* is Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) resources that assist customers with ingesting, monitoring, alerting, hunting, automating response, and more in Microsoft Sentinel. For example, Microsoft Sentinel content includes data connectors, parsers, workbooks, and analytics rules. For more information, see [About Microsoft Sentinel content and solutions](sentinel-solutions.md).

You can use the out-of-the-box (built-in) content provided in the Microsoft Sentinel Content hub and customize it for your own needs, or create your own custom content from scratch.

When creating custom content, you can store and manage it in your own Microsoft Sentinel workspaces, or an external source control repository, including GitHub and Azure DevOps repositories. This article describes how to create and manage the connections between Microsoft Sentinel and external source control repositories. Managing your content in an external repository allows you to make updates to that content outside of Microsoft Sentinel, and have it automatically deployed to your workspaces.

> [!TIP]
> This article does *not* describe how to create specific types of content from scratch. For more information, see the relevant [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/wiki#get-started) for each content type.
>

## Prerequisites and scope

Before connecting your Microsoft Sentinel workspace to an external source control repository, make sure that you have:

- Access to a GitHub or Azure DevOps repository, with any custom content files you want to deploy to your workspaces, in relevant [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](../azure-resource-manager/templates/index.yml).

    Microsoft Sentinel currently supports connections only with GitHub and Azure DevOps repositories.

- An **Owner** role in the resource group that contains your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. The **Owner** role is required to create the connection between Microsoft Sentinel and your source control repository.

### Maximum connections and deployments

- Each Microsoft Sentinel workspace is currently limited to **five connections**.

- Each Azure resource group is limited to **800 deployments** in its deployment history. If you have a high volume of ARM template deployments in your resource group(s), you may see an `Deployment QuotaExceeded` error. For more information, see [DeploymentQuotaExceeded](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-quota-exceeded) in the Azure Resource Manager templates documentation.

### Validate your content

Deploying content to Microsoft Sentinel via a repository connection does not validate that content other than verifying that the data is in the correct ARM template format.

We recommend that you validate your content templates using your regular validation process. You can leverage the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub validation process](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/wiki#test-your-contribution) and tools to set up your own validation process.

## Connect a repository

This procedure describes how to connect a GitHub or Azure DevOps repository to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, where you can save and manage your custom content, instead of in Microsoft Sentinel.

Each connection can support multiple types of custom content, including analytics rules, automation rules, hunting queries, parsers, playbooks, and workbooks. For more information, see [About Microsoft Sentinel content and solutions](sentinel-solutions.md).

**To create your connection**:

1. Make sure that you're signed into your source control app with the credentials you want to use for your connection.  If you're currently signed in using different credentials, sign out first.

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left under **Content management**, select **Repositories**.

1. Select **Add new**, and then, on the **Create a new connection** page, enter a meaningful name and description for your connection.

1. From the **Source Control** dropdown, select the type of repository you want to connect to, and then select **Authorize**.

1. Select one of the following tabs, depending on your connection type:

    # [GitHub](#tab/github)

    1. Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted.

        The first time you add a connection, you'll see a new browser window or tab, prompting you to authorize the connection to Microsoft Sentinel. If you're already logged into  your GitHub account on the same browser, your GitHub credentials will be auto-populated.

    1. A **Repository** area now shows on the **Create a new connection** page, where you can select an existing repository to connect to. Select your repository from the list, and then select **Add repository**.

        The first time you connect to a specific repository, you'll see a new browser window or tab, prompting you to install the **Azure-Sentinel** app on your repository. If you have multiple repositories, select the ones where you want to install the **Azure-Sentinel** app, and install it.

        You'll be directed to GitHub to continue the app installation.

    1. After the **Azure-Sentinel** app is installed in your repository, the **Branch** dropdown in the **Create a new connection** page is populated with your branches. Select the branch you want to connect to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

    1. From the **Content Types** dropdown, select the type of content you'll be deploying.

        - Both parsers and hunting queries use the **Saved Searches** API to deploy content to Microsoft Sentinel. If you select one of these content types, and also have content of the other type in your branch, both content types are deployed.

        - For all other content types, selecting a content type in the **Create a new connection** pane deploys only that content to Microsoft Sentinel. Content of other types is not deployed.

    1. Select **Create** to create your connection. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="media/ci-cd/create-new-connection-github.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a new GitHub repository connection.":::

    # [Azure DevOps](#tab/azure-devops)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Due to cross-tenant limitations, if you are creating a connection as a [guest user](../active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b.md) on the workspace, your Azure DevOps URL won't appear in the dropdown. Enter it manually instead.
    >

    You are automatically authorized to Azure DevOps using your current Azure credentials. To ensure valid connectivity, [verify that you've authorized to the same Azure DevOps account](https://aex.dev.azure.com/) that you're connecting to from Microsoft Sentinel or use an InPrivate browser window to create your connection.
    
    1.  In Microsoft Sentinel, from the dropdown lists that appear, select your **Organization**, **Project**, **Repository**, **Branch**, and **Content Types**.

        - Both parsers and hunting queries use the **Saved Searches** API to deploy content to Microsoft Sentinel. If you select one of these content types, and also have content of the other type in your branch, both content types are deployed.

        - For all other content types, selecting a content type in the **Create a new connection** pane deploys only that content to Microsoft Sentinel. Content of other types is not deployed.

    1. Select **Create** to create your connection. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="media/ci-cd/create-new-connection-devops.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a new GitHub repository connection.":::

    ---

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create duplicate connections, with the same repository and branch, in a single Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
    >

After the connection is created, a new workflow or pipeline is generated in your repository, and the content stored in your repository is deployed to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

The deployment time may vary depending on the amount of content that you're deploying. 

### View the deployment status

- **In GitHub**: On the repository's **Actions** tab. Select the workflow **.yaml** file shown there to access detailed deployment logs and any specific error messages, if relevant.
- **In Azure DevOps**: On the repository's **Pipelines** tab.

After the deployment is complete:

- The content stored in your repository is displayed in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, in the relevant Microsoft Sentinel page.

- The connection details on the **Repositories** page are updated with the link to the connection's deployment logs. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/ci-cd/deployment-logs-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a GitHub repository connection's deployment logs.":::

### Customize the deployment workflow

The default content deployment deploys all of the relevant custom content from the connected repository branch whenever a push is made to anything in that branch.

If the default configuration for your content deployment from GitHub or Azure DevOps does not meet all your requirements, you can modify the experience to fit your needs.

For example, you may want to configure different deployment triggers, or deploy content only from a specific root folder.

Select one of the following tabs depending on your connection type:

# [GitHub](#tab/github)

**To customize your GitHub deployment workflow**:

1. In GitHub, go to your repository and find your workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory.

    The workflow name is shown in the first line of the workflow file, and has the following default naming convention: `Deploy Content to <workspace-name> [<deployment-id>]`.

    For example: `name: Deploy Content to repositories-demo [xxxxx-dk5d-3s94-4829-9xvnc7391v83a]`

1. Select the pencil button at the top-right of the page to open the file for editing, and then modify the deployment as follows:

    - **To modify the deployment trigger**, update the `on` section in the code, which describes the event that triggers the workflow to run.

        By default, this configuration is set to `on: push`, which means that the workflow is triggered at any push to the connected branch, including both modifications to existing content and additions of new content to the repository. For example:

        ```yml
        on:
            push:
                branches: [ main ]
                paths:
                - `**`
                - `!.github/workflows/**` # this filter prevents other workflow changes from triggering this workflow
                - `.github/workflows/sentinel-deploy-<deployment-id>.yml`
        ```

        You may want to change these settings, for example, to schedule the workflow to run periodically, or to combine different workflow events together.

        For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#configuring-workflow-events) on configuring workflow events.

    - **To modify the deployment path**:

        In the default configuration shown above for the `on` section, the wildcards (`**`) in the first line in the `paths` section indicate that the entire branch is in the path for the deployment triggers.

        This default configuration means that a deployment workflow is triggered any time that content is pushed to any part of the branch.

        Later on in the file, the `jobs` section includes the following default configuration: `directory: '${{ github.workspace }}'`. This line indicates that the entire GitHub branch is in the path for the content deployment, without filtering for any folder paths.

        To deploy content from a specific folder path only, add it to both the `paths` and the `directory` configuration. For example, to deploy content only from a root folder named `SentinelContent`, update your code as follows:

        ```yml
        paths:
        - `SentinelContent/**`
        - `!.github/workflows/**` # this filter prevents other workflow changes from triggering this workflow
        - `.github/workflows/sentinel-deploy-<deployment-id>.yml`

        ...
            directory: '${{ github.workspace }}/SentinelContent'
        ```

For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) on GitHub Actions and editing GitHub workflows.

# [Azure DevOps](#tab/azure-devops)

**To customize your Azure DevOps deployment pipeline**:

1. In Azure DevOps, go to your repository and find your pipeline definition file in the `.sentinel` directory.

    The pipeline name is shown in the first line of the pipeline file, and has the following default naming convention: `Deploy Content to <workspace-name> [<deployment-id>]`.

    For example: `name: Deploy Content to repositories-demo [xxxxx-dk5d-3s94-4829-9xvnc7391v83a]`

1. Select the pencil button at the top-right of the page to open the file for editing, and then modify the deployment as follows:

    - **To modify the deployment trigger**, update the `trigger` section in the code, which describes the event that triggers the workflow to run.

        By default, this configuration is set to detect any push to the connected branch, including both modifications to existing content and additions of new content to the repository.

        Modify this trigger to any available Azure DevOps Triggers, such as to scheduling or pull request triggers. For more information, see the [Azure DevOps trigger documentation](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema).

    - **To modify the deployment path**:

        The default configuration for the `trigger` section has the following code, which indicates that the `main` branch is in the path for the deployment triggers:

        ```yml
        trigger:
            branches:
                include:
                - main
        ```

        This default configuration means that a deployment pipeline is triggered any time that content is pushed to any part of the `main` branch.

        To deploy content from a specific folder path only, add the folder name to the `include` section, for the trigger, and the `steps` section, for the deployment path, below as needed.

        For example, to deploy content only from a root folder named `SentinelContent` in your `main` branch, add `include` and `workingDirectory` settings to your code as follows:

        ```yml
        paths:
            exclude:
            - .sentinel/*
            include:
            - .sentinel/sentinel-deploy-39d8ekc8-397-5963-49g8-5k63k5953829.yml
            - SentinelContent
        ....
        steps:
        - task: AzurePowerShell@5
          inputs:
            azureSubscription: `Sentinel_Deploy_ServiceConnection_0000000000000000`
            workingDirectory: `SentinelContent`
        ```

For more information, see the [Azure DevOps documentation](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema) on the Azure DevOps YAML schema.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In both GitHub and Azure DevOps, make sure that you keep the trigger path and deployment path directories consistent.

## Edit or delete content in your repository

After you've successfully created a connection to your source control repository, anytime that content in that repository is modified or added, the deployment workflow runs again and deploys all content in the repository to all connected Microsoft Sentinel workspaces.

We recommend that you edit any content stored in a connected repository *only* in the repository, and not in Microsoft Sentinel. For example, to make changes to your analytics rules, do so directly in GitHub or Azure DevOps.

If you have edited the content in Microsoft Sentinel, make sure to export it to your source control repository to prevent your changes from being overwritten the next time the repository content is deployed to your workspace.

If you are deleting content, make sure to delete it from both your repository and the Azure portal. Deleting content from your repository does not delete it from your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

## Remove a repository connection

This procedure describes how to remove the connection to a source control repository from Microsoft Sentinel.

**To remove your connection**:

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left under **Content management**, select **Repositories**.
1. In the grid, select the connection you want to remove, and then select **Delete**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

After you've removed your connection, content that was previously deployed via the connection remains in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Content added to the repository after removing the connection is not deployed.

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter issues or an error message when deleting your connection, we recommend that you check your source control to confirm that the GitHub workflow or Azure DevOps pipeline associated with the connection was deleted.
>

### Removing the Microsoft Sentinel app from your GitHub repository

If you intend to delete the Microsoft Sentinel app from a GitHub repository, we recommend that you *first* remove all associated connections from the Microsoft Sentinel **Repositories** page.

Each Microsoft Sentinel App installation has a unique ID that's used when both adding and removing the connection. If the ID is missing or has been changed, you'll need to both remove the connection from the Microsoft Sentinel **Repositories** page and manually remove the workflow from your GitHub repository to prevent any future content deployments.

## Next steps

Use your custom content in Microsoft Sentinel in the same way that you'd use out-of-the-box content.
