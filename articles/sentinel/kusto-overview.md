# Kusto Query Language in Microsoft Sentinel

Kusto Query Language is the language you will use to work with and manipulate data in Microsoft Sentinel. The logs you feed into your workspace aren't worth much if you can't analyze them and get the important information hidden in all that data. Kusto Query Language has not only the power and flexibility to get that information, but the simplicity to help you get started quickly. If you have a background in scripting or working with databases, a lot of the content of this article will feel very familiar. If not, don't worry, as the intuitive nature of the language will quickly enable you to start writing your own queries and driving value for your organization.

This article introduces the basics of Kusto Query Language, covering some of the most used functions and operators, which should address 75 to 80 percent of the queries you will write day to day. When you'll need more depth, or to run more advanced queries, you can take advantage of the new **Advanced KQL for Microsoft Sentinel** workbook (see this [introductory blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/advanced-kql-framework-workbook-empowering-you-to-become-kql/ba-p/3033766)). See also the [official Kusto Query Language documentation](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) as well as a variety of online courses (such as [Pluralsight's](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/kusto-query-language-kql-from-scratch)).

## Background - Why Kusto Query Language?

Microsoft Sentinel is built on top of the Azure Monitor service and it uses Azure Monitor’s [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) workspaces to store all of its data. This data includes any of the following:
- data ingested from external sources into predefined tables using Microsoft Sentinel data connectors.
- data ingested from external sources into user-defined custom tables, using custom-created data connectors as well as some types of out-of-the-box connectors. 
- data created by Microsoft Sentinel itself, resulting from the analyses it creates and performs - for example, alerts, incidents, and UEBA-related information.
- data uploaded to Microsoft Sentinel to assist with detection and analysis - for example, threat intelligence feeds and watchlists.

[Kusto Query Language](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) was developed as part of the [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/) service, and it’s therefore optimized for searching through big-data stores in a cloud environment. Inspired by famed undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau (and pronounced accordingly "koo-STOH"), it’s designed to help you dive deep into your oceans of data and explore their hidden treasures. 

Kusto Query Language is also used in Azure Monitor (and therefore in Microsoft Sentinel), including some additional Azure Monitor features, to retrieve, visualize, analyze, and parse data in Log Analytics data stores. In Microsoft Sentinel, you're using tools based on Kusto Query Language whenever you’re visualizing and analyzing data and hunting for threats, whether in existing rules and workbooks, or in building your own.

Because Kusto Query Language is a part of nearly everything you do in Microsoft Sentinel, a clear understanding of how it works will help you get that much more out of your SIEM.

## What is a query?

A Kusto Query Language query is a read-only request to process data and return results – it doesn’t write any data. Queries operate on data that's organized into a hierarchy of [databases](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/schema-entities/databases), [tables](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/schema-entities/tables), and [columns](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/schema-entities/columns), similar to SQL.

Requests are stated in plain language and use a data-flow model designed to make the syntax easy to read, write, and automate. We'll see this in detail.

Kusto Query Language queries are made up of *statements* separated by semicolons. There are many kinds of statements, but only two widely used types that we’ll discuss here:

- [**tabular expression statements**](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tabularexpressionstatements) are what we typically mean when we talk about queries – these are the actual body of the query. The important thing to know about tabular expression statements is that they accept a tabular input (a table or another tabular expression) and produce a tabular output. At least one of these is required. Most of the rest of this article will discuss this kind of statement.

- [***let* statements**](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/letstatement) allow you to create and define variables and constants outside the body of the query, for easier readability and versatility. These are optional and depend on your particular needs. We'll address this kind of statement at the end of the article. 

## Demo environment

You can practice Kusto Query Language statements - including the ones in this article - in a [Log Analytics demo environment](https://aka.ms/lademo) in the Azure portal. There is no charge to use this practice environment, but you do need an Azure account to access it.

Explore the demo environment. Like Log Analytics in your production environment, it can be used in a number of ways:

- **Choose a table on which to build a query.** From the default **Tables** tab (shown in the red rectangle at the upper left), select a table from the list of tables grouped by topics (shown at the lower left). Expand the topics to see the individual tables, and you can further expand each table to see all its fields (columns). Double-clicking on a table or a field name will place it at the point of the cursor in the query window. Type the rest of your query following the table name, as directed below.

- **Find an existing query to study or modify.** Select the **Queries** tab (shown in the red rectangle at the upper left) to see a list of queries available out-of-the-box. Or, select **Queries** from the button bar at the top right. You can explore the queries that come with Microsoft Sentinel out-of-the-box. Double-clicking a query will place the whole query in the query window at the point of the cursor.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/kusto-overview/portal-placement.png" alt-text="Shows the Log Analytics demo environment.":::

Like in this demo environment, you can query and filter data in the Microsoft Sentinel **Logs** page. You can select a table and drill down to see columns. You can modify the default columns shown using the **Column chooser**, and you can set the default time range for queries. If the time range is explicitly defined in the query, the time filter will be unavailable (grayed out).


## Query structure

A good place to start learning Kusto Query Language is to understand the overall query structure. The first thing you'll notice when looking at a Kusto query is the use of the pipe symbol (` | `). The structure of a Kusto query starts with getting your data from a data source and then passing the data across a "pipeline," and each step provides some level of processing and then passes the data to the next step. At the end of the pipeline, you will get your final result. In effect, this is our pipeline:

`Get Data | Filter | Summarize | Sort | Select`

This concept of passing data down the pipeline makes for a very intuitive structure, as it is easy to create a mental picture of your data at each step.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at the following query, which looks at Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in logs. As you read through each line, you can see the keywords that indicate what's happening to the data. We've included the relevant stage in the pipeline as a comment in each line.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add comments to any line in a query by preceding them with a double slash (` // `).

```kusto
SigninLogs                              // Get data
| evaluate bag_unpack(LocationDetails)  // Ignore this line for now; we'll come back to it at the end.
| where RiskLevelDuringSignIn == 'none' // Filter
   and TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)         // Filter
| summarize Count = count() by city     // Summarize
| sort by Count desc                    // Sort
| take 5                                // Select
```

Because the output of every step serves as the input for the following step, the order of the steps can determine the query's results and affect its performance. It's crucial that you order the steps according to what you want to get out of the query.

> [!TIP]
> - A good rule of thumb is to filter your data early, so you are only passing relevant data down the pipeline. This will greatly increase performance and ensure that you aren't accidentally including irrelevant data in summarization steps.
> - This article will point out some other best practices to keep in mind. For a more complete list, see [query best practices](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/best-practices).

Hopefully, you now have an appreciation for the overall structure of a query in Kusto Query Language. Now let's look at the actual query operators themselves, which are used to create a query.

### Data types

Before we get into the query operators, let's first take a quick look at [data types](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/). As in most languages, the data type determines what calculations and manipulations can be run against a value. For example, if you have a value that is of type *string*, you won't be able to perform arithmetic calculations against it.

In Kusto Query Language, most of the data types follow standard conventions and have names you've probably seen before. The following table shows the full list:

#### Data type table

| Type       | Additional name(s) | Equivalent .NET type              |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `bool`     | `Boolean`          | `System.Boolean`                  |
| `datetime` | `Date`             | `System.DateTime`                 |
| `dynamic`  |                    | `System.Object`                   |
| `guid`     | `uuid`, `uniqueid` | `System.Guid`                     |
| `int`      |                    | `System.Int32`                    |
| `long`     |                    | `System.Int64`                    |
| `real`     | `Double`           | `System.Double`                   |
| `string`   |                    | `System.String`                   |
| `timespan` | `Time`             | `System.TimeSpan`                 |
| `decimal`  |                    | `System.Data.SqlTypes.SqlDecimal` |
| | | |

While most of the data types are standard, you might be less familiar with types like *dynamic*, *timespan*, and *guid*.

***Dynamic*** has a structure very similar to JSON, but with one key difference: It can store Kusto Query Language-specific data types that traditional JSON cannot, such as a nested *dynamic* value, or *timespan*. Here's an example of a dynamic type:

```json
{
"countryOrRegion":"US",
"geoCoordinates": {
"longitude":-122.12094116210936,
"latitude":47.68050003051758
},
"state":"Washington",
"city":"Redmond"
}
```

***Timespan*** is a data type that refers to a measure of time such as hours, days, or seconds. Do not confuse *timespan* with *datetime*, which evaluates to an actual date and time, not a measure of time. The following table shows a list of *timespan* suffixes.

#### *Timespan* suffixes

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `D` | days |
| `H` | hours |
| `M` | minutes |
| `S` | seconds |
| `Ms` | milliseconds |
| `Microsecond` | microseconds |
| `Tick` | nanoseconds |
| | |

***Guid*** is a datatype representing a 128-bit, globally-unique identifier, which follows the standard format of [8]-[4]-[4]-[4]-[12], where each [number] represents the number of characters and each character can range from 0-9 or a-f.

> [!NOTE]
> Kusto Query Language has both tabular and scalar operators. Throughout the rest of this article, if you simply see the word "operator," you can assume it means tabular operator, unless otherwise noted.

## Getting, limiting, sorting, and filtering data

The core vocabulary of Kusto Query Language - the foundation that will allow you to accomplish the overwhelming majority of your tasks - is a collection of operators for filtering, sorting, and selecting your data. The remaining tasks you will need to do will require you to stretch your knowledge of the language to meet your more advanced needs. Let's expand a bit on some of the commands we used [in our above example](#query-structure) and look at `take`, `sort`, and `where`.

For each of these operators, we'll examine its use in our previous *SigninLogs* example, and learn either a useful tip or a best practice.

### Getting data

The first line of any basic query specifies which table you want to work with. In the case of Microsoft Sentinel, this will likely be the name of a log type in your workspace, such as *SigninLogs*, *SecurityAlert*, or *CommonSecurityLog*. For example:

`SigninLogs`

Note that in Kusto Query Language, log names are case sensitive, so `SigninLogs` and `signinLogs` will be interpreted differently. Take care when choosing names for your custom logs, so they are easily identifiable and not too similar to another log.

### Limiting data: *take* / *limit*

The [*take*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/takeoperator) operator (and the identical [limit](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/limitoperator) operator) is used to limit your results by returning only a given number of rows. It's followed by an integer that specifies the number of rows to return. Typically, it's used at the end of a query after you have determined your sort order, and in such a case it will return the given number of rows at the top of the sorted order.

Using `take` earlier in the query can be useful for testing a query, when you don't want to return large datasets. However, if you place the `take` operation before any `sort` operations, `take` will return rows selected at random - and possibly a different set of rows every time the query is run.  Here's an example of using take:

```kusto
SigninLogs
      | take 5
```
:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/table-take-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results of take operator.":::

> [!TIP]
> When working on a brand-new query where you may not know what the query will look like, it can be useful to put a `take` statement at the beginning to artificially limit your dataset for faster processing and experimentation. Once you are happy with the full query, you can remove the initial `take` step.

### Sorting data: *sort* / *order*

The [*sort*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/sortoperator) operator (and the identical [order](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/orderoperator) operator) is used to sort your data by a specified column. In the following example, we ordered the results by *TimeGenerated* and set the order direction to descending with the *desc* parameter, placing the highest values first; for ascending order we would use *asc*. 

> [!NOTE]
> The default direction for sorts is descending, so technically you only have to specify if you want to sort in ascending order. However, specifying the sort direction in any case will make your query more readable.

```kusto
SigninLogs
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
| take 5
```

As we mentioned, we put the `sort` operator before the `take` operator. We need to sort first to make sure we get the appropriate five records.

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/table-take-sort.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results of sort operator, with take limit.":::

#### *Top*

The [*top*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/topoperator) operator allows us to combine the `sort` and `take` operations into a single operator:

```kusto
SigninLogs
| top 5 by TimeGenerated desc
```

In cases where two or more records have the same value in the column you are sorting by, you can add more columns to sort by. Add extra sorting columns in a comma-separated list, located after the first sorting column, but before the sort order keyword. For example:

```kusto
SigninLogs
| sort by TimeGenerated, Identity desc
| take 5
```

Now, if *TimeGenerated* is the same between multiple records, it will then try to sort by the value in the *Identity* column.

> [!NOTE]
> **When to use `sort` and `take`, and when to use `top`**
>
> - If you're only sorting on one field, use `top`, as it provides better performance than the combination of `sort` and `take`.
>
> - If you need to sort on more than one field (like in the last example above), `top` can't do that, so you must use `sort` and `take`.

### Filtering data: *where*

The [*where*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator) operator is arguably the most important operator, because it's the key to making sure you are only working with the subset of data that is relevant to your scenario. You should do your best to filter your data as early in the query as possible because doing so will improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in subsequent steps; it also ensures that you are only performing calculations on the desired data. See this example:

```kusto
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
| sort by TimeGenerated, Identity desc
| take 5
```

The `where` operator specifies a variable, a comparison (*scalar*) operator, and a value. In our case, we used `>=` to denote that the value in the *TimeGenerated* column needs to be greater than (that is, later than) or equal to seven days ago.

There are two types of comparison operators in Kusto Query Language: string and numerical. The following table shows the full list of numerical operators:

#### Numerical operators

| Operator | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition                         |
| `-`      | Subtraction                      |
| `*`      | Multiplication                   |
| `/`      | Division                         |
| `%`      | Modulo                           |
| `<`      | Less than                        |
| `>`      | Greater than                     |
| `==`     | Equal to                         |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                     |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to            |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to         |
| `in`     | Equal to one of the elements     |
| `!in`    | Not equal to any of the elements |
| 

The list of string operators is a much longer list because it has permutations for case sensitivity, substring locations, prefixes, suffixes, and much more. The `==` operator is both a numeric and string operator, meaning it can be used for both numbers and text. For example, both of the following statements would be valid where statements:

- `| where ResultType == 0`  
- `| where Category == 'SignInLogs'`

> [!TIP]
> **Best Practice:** In most cases, you will probably want to filter your data by more than one column, or filter the same column in more than one way. In these instances, there are two best practices you should keep in mind.
> 
> You can combine multiple `where` statements into a single step by using the *and* keyword. For example:
> 
> ```kusto
> SigninLogs
> | where Resource == ResourceGroup
>     and TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
> ```
> 
> When you have multiple filters joined into a single `where` statement using the *and* keyword, like above, you will get better performance by putting filters that only reference a single column first. So, a better way to write the above query would be:
> 
> ```kusto
> SigninLogs
> | where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
>     and Resource == ResourceGroup
> ```
>
> In this example, the first filter mentions a single column (*TimeGenerated*), while the second references two columns (*Resource* and *ResourceGroup*).

## Summarizing data

[*Summarize*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/summarizeoperator) is one of the most important tabular operators in Kusto Query Language, but it also is one of the more complex operators to learn if you are new to query languages in general. The job of `summarize` is to take in a table of data and output a *new table* that is aggregated by one or more columns.

### Structure of the summarize statement

The basic structure of a `summarize` statement is as follows:

`| summarize <aggregation> by <column>`

For example, the following would return the count of records for each *CounterName* value in the *Perf* table:

```kusto
Perf
| summarize count() by CounterName
```

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/table-summarize-count.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results of summarize operator with count aggregation.":::

Because the output of `summarize` is a new table, any columns not explicitly specified in the `summarize` statement will **not** be passed down the pipeline. To illustrate this concept, consider this example:

```kusto
Perf
| project ObjectName, CounterValue, CounterName
| summarize count() by CounterName
| sort by ObjectName asc
```

On the second line, we are specifying that we only care about the columns *ObjectName*, *CounterValue*, and *CounterName*. We then summarized to get the record count by *CounterName* and finally, we attempt to sort the data in ascending order based on the *ObjectName* column. Unfortunately, this query will fail with an error (indicating that the *ObjectName* is unknown) because when we summarized, we only included the *Count* and *CounterName* columns in our new table. To avoid this error, we can simply add *ObjectName* to the end of our `summarize` step, like this:

```kusto
Perf
| project ObjectName, CounterValue , CounterName
| summarize count() by CounterName, ObjectName
| sort by ObjectName asc
```

The way to read the `summarize` line in your head would be: "summarize the count of records by *CounterName*, and group by *ObjectName*". You can continue adding columns, separated by commas, to the end of the `summarize` statement.

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/table-summarize-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results of summarize operator with two arguments.":::

Building on the previous example, if we want to aggregate multiple columns at the same time, we can achieve this by adding aggregations to the `summarize` operator, separated by commas. In the example below, we are getting not only a count of all the records but also a sum of the values in the *CounterValue* column across all records (that match any filters in the query):

```kusto
Perf
| project ObjectName, CounterValue , CounterName
| summarize count(), sum(CounterValue) by CounterName, ObjectName
| sort by ObjectName asc
```

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/table-summarize-multiple.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results of summarize operator with multiple aggregations.":::

#### Renaming aggregated columns

This seems like a good time to talk about column names for these aggregated columns. [At the start of this section](#summarizing-data), we said the `summarize` operator takes in a table of data and produces a new table, and only the columns you specify in the `summarize` statement will continue down the pipeline. Therefore, if you were to run the above example, the resulting columns for our aggregation would be *count_* and *sum_CounterValue*.

The Kusto engine will automatically create a column name without us having to be explicit, but often, you will find that you will prefer your new column have a friendlier name. You can easily rename your column in the `summarize` statement by specifying a new name, followed by ` = ` and the aggregation, like so:

```kusto
Perf
| project ObjectName, CounterValue , CounterName
| summarize Count = count(), CounterSum = sum(CounterValue) by CounterName, ObjectName
| sort by ObjectName asc
```

Now, our summarized columns will be named *Count* and *CounterSum*.

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/friendly-column-names.png" alt-text="Screenshot of friendly column names for aggregations.":::

There is much more to the `summarize` operator than we can cover here, but you should invest the time to learn it because it is a key component to any data analysis you plan to perform on your Microsoft Sentinel data.

### Aggregation reference

The are many aggregation functions, but some of the most commonly used are `sum()`, `count()`, and `avg()`. Here's a partial list (see the [full list](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/aggregation-functions)):

#### Aggregation functions

| Function        | Description                                                            |

| `sum()`         | Returns the sum of the elements within the group                       |
| `take_any()`    | Returns random non-empty value for the group                           |
| `variance()`    | Returns the variance across the group                                  |
| 


## Selecting: adding and removing columns

As you start working more with queries, you may find that you have more information than you need on your subjects (that is, too many columns in your table). Or you might need more information than you have (that is, you need to add a new column that will contain the results of analysis of other columns). Let's look at a few of the key operators for column manipulation.

### *Project* and *project-away*

[*Project*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator) is roughly equivalent to many languages' *select* statements. It allows you to choose which columns to keep. The order of the columns returned will match the order of the columns you list in your `project` statement, as shown in this example:

```kusto
Perf
| project ObjectName, CounterValue, CounterName
```

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-overview/table-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results of project operator.":::

As you can imagine, when you are working with very wide datasets, you may have lots of columns you want to keep, and specifying them all by name would require a lot of typing. For those cases, you have [*project-away*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectawayoperator), which lets you specify which columns to remove, rather than which ones to keep, like so:

```kusto
Perf
| project-away MG, _ResourceId, Type
```

> [!TIP]
> It can be useful to use `project` in two locations in your queries, at the beginning and again at the end. Using `project` early in your query can help improve performance by stripping away large chunks of data you don't need to pass down the pipeline. Using it again at the end lets you get rid of any columns that may have been created in previous steps and aren't needed in your final output.

### *Extend*

[*Extend*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/extendoperator) is used to create a new calculated column. This can be useful when you want to perform a calculation against existing columns and see the output for every row. Let's look at a simple example where we calculate a new column called *Kbytes*, which we can calculate by multiplying the MB value (in the existing *Quantity* column) by 1,024.

```kusto
Usage
| where QuantityUnit == 'MBytes'
| extend KBytes = Quantity * 1024
| project ResourceUri, MBytes=Quantity, KBytes
```

On the final line in our `project` statement, we renamed the *Quantity* column to *Mbytes*, so we can easily tell which unit of measure is relevant to each column.

It's worth noting that `extend` also works with already calculated columns. For example, we can add one more column called *Bytes* that is calculated from *Kbytes*:

```kusto
Usage
| where QuantityUnit == 'MBytes'
| extend KBytes = Quantity * 1024
| extend Bytes = KBytes * 1024
| project ResourceUri, MBytes=Quantity, KBytes, Bytes
```

## Joining tables

Much of your work in Microsoft Sentinel can be carried out by using a single log type, but there are times when you will want to correlate data together or perform a lookup against another set of data. Like most query languages, Kusto Query Language offers a few operators used to perform various types of joins. In this section, we will look at the most-used operators, `union` and `join`.

### *Union*

[*Union*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/unionoperator?pivots=azuremonitor) simply takes two or more tables and returns all the rows. For example:

```kusto
OfficeActivity
| union SecurityEvent
```

This would return all rows from both the *OfficeActivity* and *SecurityEvent* tables. `Union` offers a few parameters that can be used to adjust how the union behaves. Two of the most useful are *withsource* and *kind*:

```kusto
OfficeActivity
| union withsource = SourceTable kind = inner SecurityEvent
```

The *withsource* parameter lets you specify the name of a new column whose value in a given row will be the name of the table from which the row came. In the example above, we named the column SourceTable, and depending on the row, the value will either be *OfficeActivity* or *SecurityEvent*.

The other parameter we specified was *kind*, which has two options: *inner* or *outer*. In the example above, we specified *inner*, which means the only columns that will be kept during the union are those that exist in both tables. Alternatively, if we had specified *outer* (which is the default value), then all columns from both tables would be returned.

### *Join*

[*Join*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/joinoperator?pivots=azuremonitor) works similarly to `union`, except instead of joining tables to make a new table, we are joining *rows* to make a new table. Like most database languages, there are multiple types of joins you can perform. The general syntax for a `join` is:

```kusto
T1
| join kind = <join type>
(
               T2
) on $left.<T1Column> == $right.<T2Column>
```

After the `join` operator, we specify the *kind* of join we want to perform followed by an open parenthesis. Within the parentheses is where you specify the table you want to join, as well as any other query statements on *that* table you wish to add. After the closing parenthesis, we use the *on* keyword followed by our left (*$left.\<columnName>* keyword) and right (*$right.\<columnName>*) columns separated with the == operator. Here's an example of an *inner join*:

```kusto
OfficeActivity
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(1d)
    and LogonUserSid != ''
| join kind = inner (
    SecurityEvent
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(1d)
        and SubjectUserSid != ''
) on $left.LogonUserSid == $right.SubjectUserSid
```

> [!NOTE]
> If both tables have the same name for the columns on which you are performing a join, you don't need to use *$left* and *$right*; instead, you can just specify the column name. Using *$left* and *$right*, however, is more explicit and generally considered to be a good practice.

For your reference, the following table shows a list of available types of joins.

#### Types of Joins

| Join Type | Description |
| - | - |
| `inner`                     | Returns a single for each combination of matching rows from both tables. |
| `innerunique`               | Returns rows from the left table with distinct values in linked field that have a match in the right table. <br>This is the default unspecified join type. |
| `leftsemi`                  | Returns all records from the left table that have a match in the right table. <br>Only columns from the left table will be returned. |
| `rightsemi`                 | Returns all records from the right table that have a match in the left table. <br>Only columns from the right table will be returned. |
| `leftanti`/<br>`leftantisemi`   | Returns all records from the left table that don't have a match in the right table. <br>Only columns from the left table will be returned. |
| `rightanti`/<br>`rightantisemi` | Returns all records from the right table that don't have a match in the left table. <br>Only columns from the right table will be returned. |
| `leftouter` | Returns all records from the left table. For records that have no match in the right table, cell values will be null. |
| `rightouter` | Returns all records from the right table. For records that have no match in the left table, cell values will be null. |
| `fullouter`                 | Returns all records from both left and right tables, matching or not. <br>Unmatched values will be null. |
| 

> [!TIP]
> **It's a best practice** to have your smallest table on the left. In some cases, following this rule can give you huge performance benefits, depending on the types of joins you are performing and the size of the tables.

## Evaluate

You may remember that back [in the first example](#query-structure), we saw the [*evaluate*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/evaluateoperator) operator on one of the lines. The `evaluate` operator is less commonly used than the ones we have touched on previously. However, knowing how the `evaluate` operator works is well worth your time. Once more, here is that first query, where you will see `evaluate` on the second line.

```kusto
SigninLogs
| evaluate bag_unpack(LocationDetails)
| where RiskLevelDuringSignIn == 'none'
   and TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
| summarize Count = count() by city
| sort by Count desc
| take 5
```

This operator allows you to invoke available plugins (basically built-in functions). Many of these plugins are focused around data science, such as [*autocluster*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/autoclusterplugin), [*diffpatterns*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/diffpatternsplugin), and [*sequence_detect*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/sequence-detect-plugin), allowing you to perform advanced analysis and discover statistical anomalies and outliers.

The plugin used in the above example was called [*bag_unpack*](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/bag-unpackplugin), and it makes it very easy to take a chunk of dynamic data and convert it to columns. Remember, [dynamic data](#data-type-table) is a data type that looks very similar to JSON, as shown in this example:

```json
{
"countryOrRegion":"US",
"geoCoordinates": {
"longitude":-122.12094116210936,
"latitude":47.68050003051758
},
"state":"Washington",
"city":"Redmond"
}
```

In this case, we wanted to summarize the data by city, but *city* is contained as a property within the *LocationDetails* column. To use the *city* property in our query, we had to first convert it to a column using *bag_unpack*.

Going back to our original pipeline steps, we saw this:

`Get Data | Filter | Summarize | Sort | Select`

Now that we've considered the `evaluate` operator, we can see that it represents a new stage in the pipeline, which now looks like this:

`Get Data | `***`Parse`***` | Filter | Summarize | Sort | Select`

There are many other examples of operators and functions that can be used to parse data sources into a more readable and manipulatable format. You can learn about them - and the rest of the Kusto Query Language - in the [full documentation](#more-resources) and in the [workbook](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/advanced-kql-framework-workbook-empowering-you-to-become-kql/ba-p/3033766).

## Let statements

Now that we've covered many of the major operators and data types, let's wrap up with the [*let* statement](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/letstatement), which is a great 
way to make your queries easier to read, edit, and maintain.

*Let* allows you to create and set a variable, or to assign a name to an expression. This expression could be a single value, but it could also be a whole query. Here's a simple example:

```kusto
let aWeekAgo = ago(7d);
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= aWeekAgo
```

Here, we specified a name of *aWeekAgo* and set it to be equal to the output of a *timespan* function, which returns a *datetime* value. We then terminate the *let* statement with a semicolon. Now we have a new variable called *aWeekAgo* that can be used anywhere in our query.

As we just mentioned, you can use a *let* statement to take a whole query and give the result a name. Since query results, being tabular expressions, can be used as the inputs of queries, you can treat this named result as a table for the purposes of running another query on it. Here's a slight modification to the previous example:

```kusto
let aWeekAgo = ago(7d);
let getSignins = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= aWeekAgo;
getSignins
```

In this case, we created a second *let* statement, where we wrapped our whole query into a new variable called *getSignins*. Just like before, we terminate the second *let* statement with a semicolon. Then we call the variable on the final line, which will run the query. Notice that we were able to use *aWeekAgo* in the second *let* statement. This is because we specified it on the previous line; if we were to swap the *let* statements so that *getSignins* came first, we would get an error.

Now we can use *getSignins* as the basis of another query (in the same window):

```kusto
let aWeekAgo = ago(7d);
let getSignins = SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= aWeekAgo;
getSignins
| where level >= 3
| project IPAddress, UserDisplayName, Level
```

*Let* statements give you more power and flexibility in helping to organize your queries. *Let* can define scalar and tabular values as well as create user-defined functions. They truly come in handy when you are organizing more complex queries that may be doing multiple joins.
