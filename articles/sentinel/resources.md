# Useful resources for working with Microsoft Sentinel

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

This article lists resources that can help you get more information about working with Microsoft Sentinel.

## Learn more about creating queries

Microsoft Sentinel uses Azure Monitor Log Analytics's Kusto Query Language (KQL) to build queries. For more information, see:

- [Kusto Query Language in Microsoft Sentinel](kusto-overview.md)
- [Useful resources for working with Kusto Query Language in Microsoft Sentinel](kusto-resources.md)

## Microsoft Sentinel templates for data to monitor

The [Azure Active Directory Security Operations Guide](../active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-introduction.md) includes specific guidance and knowledge about data that's important to monitor for security purposes, for several operational areas. 

In each article, check for sections named [Things to monitor](../active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-privileged-accounts.md#things-to-monitor) for lists of events that we recommend alerting on and investigating, as well as analytics rule templates to deploy directly to Microsoft Sentinel.

## Learn more about creating automation

Create automation in Microsoft Sentinel using Azure Logic Apps, with a growing gallery of built-in playbooks. 

For more information, see [Azure Logic Apps connectors](/connectors/).

## Compare playbooks, workbooks, and notebooks

The following table describes the differences between playbooks, workbooks, and notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel:
