# Build queries or detection rules with watchlists in Microsoft Sentinel

Query data in any table against data from a watchlist by treating the watchlist as a table for joins and lookups. When you create a watchlist, you define the *SearchKey*. The search key is the name of a column in your watchlist that you expect to use as a join with other data or as a frequent object of searches.

For optimal query performance, use **Searchkey** as the key for joins in your queries.

## Build queries with watchlists

To use a watchlist in search query, write a Kusto query that uses the _GetWatchlist('watchlist-name') function and uses **SearchKey** as the key for your join.

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Microsoft Sentinel** and select the appropriate workspace.
1. Under **Configuration**, select **Watchlist**.
1. Select the watchlist you want to use.
1. Select **View in Log Analytics**.

1. Review the **Results** tab. The items in your watchlist are automatically extracted for your query. 

   The example below shows the results of the extraction of the **Name** and **IP Address** fields. The **SearchKey** is shown as its own column. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/watchlists/sentinel-watchlist-queries-fields.png" alt-text="queries with watchlist fields" lightbox="./media/watchlists/sentinel-watchlist-queries-fields.png":::

    The timestamp on your queries will be ignored in both the query UI and in scheduled alerts.

1. Write a query that uses the _GetWatchlist('watchlist-name') function and uses **SearchKey** as the key for your join. 

   For example, the following example query joins the `RemoteIPCountry` column in the `Heartbeat` table with the search key defined for the watchlist named mywatchlist.

    ```kusto
    Heartbeat
    | lookup kind=leftouter _GetWatchlist('mywatchlist') 
     on $left.RemoteIPCountry == $right.SearchKey
    ```

    The following image shows the results of this example query in Log Analytics.

## Create an analytics rule with a watchlist

To use watchlists in analytics rules, create a rule using the _GetWatchlist('watchlist-name') function in the query.

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Microsoft Sentinel** and select the appropriate workspace.
1. Under **Configuration**, select **Analytics**.
1. Select **Create** and the type of rule you want to create.
1. On the **General**, enter the appropriate information.
1. On the **Set rule logic** tab, under **Rule query** use the `_GetWatchlist('<watchlist>')` function in the query.

   For example, let's say you have a watchlist named “ipwatchlist”  that you created from a CSV file with the following values:

   |IPAddress,Location   |
   |---------|
   | 10.0.100.11,Home     |
   |172.16.107.23,Work     |
   |10.0.150.39,Home     |
   |172.20.32.117,Work   |

    The CSV file looks something like the following image.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/watchlists/create-watchlist.png" alt-text="Screenshot of four items in a CSV file that's used for the watchlist.":::

    To use the `_GetWatchlist` function for this example, your query would be `_GetWatchlist('ipwatchlist')`.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/watchlists/sentinel-watchlist-new-other.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the query returns the four items from the watchlist.":::

    In this example, we only include events from IP addresses in the watchlist:

    ```kusto
    //Watchlist as a variable
    let watchlist = (_GetWatchlist('ipwatchlist') | project IPAddress);
    Heartbeat
    | where ComputerIP in (watchlist)
    ```

    The following example query uses the watchlist inline with the query and the search key defined for the watchlist.

    ```kusto
    //Watchlist inline with the query
    //Use SearchKey for the best performance
    Heartbeat
    | where ComputerIP in ( 
        (_GetWatchlist('ipwatchlist')
        | project SearchKey)
    )
    ```

    The following image shows this last query used in the rule query.

1. Complete the rest of the tabs in the **Analytics rule wizard**.

For more information, see [Create custom analytics rules to detect threats](detect-threats-custom.md).

## View list of watchlist aliases

You might need to see a list of watchlist aliases to identify a watchlist to use in a query or analytics rule.

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Microsoft Sentinel** and select the appropriate workspace.
1. Under **General**, select **Logs**.
1. If you see a list of queries, closes the **Queries** window.
1. On the **New Query** page, run the following query: `_GetWatchlistAlias`. 
1. Review the list of aliases in the **Results** tab.
