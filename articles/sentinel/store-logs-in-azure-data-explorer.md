# Integrate Azure Data Explorer for long-term log retention

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

By default, logs ingested into Microsoft Sentinel are stored in Azure Monitor Log Analytics. This article explains how to reduce retention costs in Microsoft Sentinel by sending them to Azure Data Explorer for long-term retention.

Storing logs in Azure Data Explorer reduces costs while retains your ability to query your data, and is especially useful as your data grows. For example, while security data may lose value over time, you may be required to retain logs for regulatory requirements or to run periodic investigations on older data.

## About Azure Data Explorer

Azure Data Explorer is a big data analytics platform that is highly optimized for log and data analytics. Since Azure Data Explorer uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) as its query language, it's a good alternative for Microsoft Sentinel data storage. Using Azure Data Explorer for your data storage enables you to run cross-platform queries and visualize data across both Azure Data Explorer and Microsoft Sentinel.

For more information, see:

- [Azure Data Explorer documentation](/azure/data-explorer/)
- [Azure Data Explorer blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/tag/azure-data-explorer/)
- [General architectures for long-term security log retention with Azure Data Explorer](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/security/security-log-retention-azure-data-explorer)

### When to integrate with Azure Data Explorer

Microsoft Sentinel provides full SIEM and SOAR capabilities, quick deployment and configuration, as well as advanced, built-in security features for SOC teams. However, the value of storing security data in Microsoft Sentinel may drop after a few months, once SOC users don't need to access it as often as they access newer data.

If you only need to access specific tables occasionally, such as for periodic investigations or audits, you may consider that retaining your data in Microsoft Sentinel is no longer cost-effective. At this point, we recommend storing data in Azure Data Explorer, which costs less, but still enables you to explore using the same KQL queries that you run in Microsoft Sentinel.

You can access the data in Azure Data Explorer directly from Microsoft Sentinel using the [Log Analytics Azure Data Explorer proxy feature](../azure-monitor/logs/azure-monitor-data-explorer-proxy.md). To do so, use cross cluster queries in your log search or workbooks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Core SIEM capabilities, including Analytic rules, UEBA, and the investigation graph, do not support data stored in Azure Data Explorer.
>

> [!NOTE]
> Integrating with Azure Data Explorer can also enable you to have control and granularity in your data. For more information, see [Design considerations](#design-considerations).
>
## Send data directly to Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Data Explorer in parallel

You may want to retain any data *with security value* in Microsoft Sentinel to use in detections, incident investigations, threat hunting, UEBA, and so on. Keeping this data in Microsoft Sentinel mainly benefits Security Operations Center (SOC) users, where typically, 3-12 months of storage are enough.

You can also configure all of your data, *regardless of its security value,* to be sent to Azure Data Explorer at the same time, where you can store it for longer. While sending data to both Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Data Explorer at the same time results in some duplication, the cost savings can be significant as you reduce the retention costs in Microsoft Sentinel.

> [!TIP]
> This option also enables you to correlate data spread across data stores, such as to enrich the security data stored in Microsoft Sentinel with operational or long-term data stored in Azure Data Explorer. For more information, see [Cross-resource query Azure Data Explorer by using Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/logs/azure-monitor-data-explorer-proxy.md).
>

The following image shows how you can retain all of your data in Azure Data Explorer, while sending only your security data to Microsoft Sentinel for daily use.

For more information about implementing this architecture option, see [Azure Data Explorer monitoring](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/monitor-azure-data-explorer).

## Export data from Log Analytics into Azure Data Explorer

Instead of sending your data directly to Azure Data Explorer, you can choose to export your data from Log Analytics into Azure Data Explorer via an Azure Event Hub or Azure Data Factory.

### Data export architecture

The following image shows a sample flow of exported data through the Azure Monitor ingestion pipeline. Your data is directed to Log Analytics by default, but you can also configure it to export to an Azure Storage Account or Event Hub.

:::image type="content" source="media/store-logs-in-adx/export-data-from-azure-monitor.png" alt-text="Export data from Azure Monitor - architecture.":::

When configuring the data export rules, select the types of logs you want to export. Once configured, new data arriving at the Log Analytics ingestion endpoint, and targeted to your workspace for the selected tables, is exported to your Storage Account or Event hub.

When configuring data for export, note the following considerations:

|Consideration  | Details |
|---------|---------|
|**Scope of data exported**     |  Once export is configured for a specific table, all data sent to that table is exported, with no exception. Exported a filtered subset of your data, or limiting the export to specific events, is not supported.       |
|**Location requirements**     |   Both the Azure Monitor / Microsoft Sentinel workspace, and the destination location (an Azure Storage Account or Event Hub) must be located in the same geographical region.      |
|**Supported tables**     | Not all tables are supported for export, such as custom log tables, which are not supported. <br><br>For more information, see [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export.md) and the [list of supported tables](../azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export.md#supported-tables).         |
|     |         |

### Data export methods and procedures

Use one of the following procedures to export data from Microsoft Sentinel into Azure Data Explorer:

- **Via an Azure Event Hub**. Export data from Log Analytics into an Event Hub, where you can ingest it into Azure Data Explorer. This method stores some data (the first X months) in both Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Data Explorer.

- **Via Azure Storage and Azure Data Factory**. Export your data from Log Analytics into Azure Blob Storage, then Azure Data Factory is used to run a periodic copy job to further export the data into Azure Data Explorer. This method enables you to copy data from Azure Data Factory only when it nears its retention limit in Microsoft Sentinel / Log Analytics, avoiding duplication.

### [Azure Event Hub](#tab/adx-event-hub)

This section describes how to export Microsoft Sentinel data from Log Analytics into an Event Hub, where you can ingest it into Azure Data Explorer. Similar to [sending data directly to Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Data Explorer in parallel](#send-data-directly-to-microsoft-sentinel-and-azure-data-explorer-in-parallel), this method includes some data duplication as the data is streamed into Azure Data Explorer as it arrives in Log Analytics.

The following image shows a sample flow of exported data into an Event Hub, from where it's ingested into Azure Data Explorer.

:::image type="content" source="media/store-logs-in-adx/ingest-data-to-adx-via-event-hub.png" alt-text="Export data into Azure Data Explorer via an Azure Event Hub.":::

The architecture shown in the previous image provides the full Microsoft Sentinel SIEM experience, including incident management, visual investigations, threat hunting, advanced visualizations, UEBA, and more, for data that must be accessed frequently, every *X* months. At the same time, this architecture also enables you to query long-term data by accessing it directly in Azure Data Explorer, or via Microsoft Sentinel thanks to the Azure Data Explorer proxy feature. Queries to long-term data storage in Azure Data Explorer can be ported without any changes from Microsoft Sentinel to Azure Data Explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> When exporting multiple data tables into Azure Data Explorer via Event Hub, keep in mind that Log Analytics data export has limitations for the maximum number of Event Hubs per namespace. For more information about data export [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export.md?tabs=portal).
>
> For most customers, we recommend using the Event Hub Standard tier. Depending on the amount of tables you need to export and the amount of traffic to those tables, you may need to use Event Hub Dedicated tier. For more information, see [Event Hub documentation](../event-hubs/event-hubs-quotas.md).

**To export data into Azure Data Explorer via an Event Hub**:

1. **Configure the Log Analytics data export to an Event Hub**. For more information, see [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export.md).

1. **Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database**. For more information, see:

    - [Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database](/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-database-portal)
    - [Select the correct compute SKU for your Azure Data Explorer cluster](/azure/data-explorer/manage-cluster-choose-sku)

1. **Create target tables**. The raw data is first ingested to an intermediate table, where the raw data is stored, manipulated, and expanded.

    An update policy, which is similar to a function applied to all new data, is used to ingest the expanded data into the final table, which has the same schema as the original table in Microsoft Sentinel.

    Set the retention on the raw table to **0** days. The data is stored only in the properly formatted table, and deleted in the raw table as soon as it's transformed.

    For more information, see [Ingest and query monitoring data in Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-no-code?tabs=diagnostic-metrics).

1. <a name="mapping"></a>**Create table mapping**. Map the JSON tables to define how records land in the raw events table as they come in from an Event Hub. For more information, see [Create the update policy for metric and log data](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-no-code?tabs=diagnostic-metrics).

1. **Create an update policy and attach it to the raw records table**. In this step, create a function, called an update policy, and attach it to the destination table so that the data is transformed at ingestion time.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This step is required only when you want to have data tables in Azure Data Explorer with the same schema and format as in Microsoft Sentinel.
    >

    For more information, see [Connect an Event Hub to Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-no-code?tabs=activity-logs).

1. **Create a data connection between the Event Hub and the raw data table in Azure Data Explorer**. Configure Azure Data Explorer with details of how to export the data into the Event Hub.

    Use the instructions in the [Azure Data Explorer documentation](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-no-code?tabs=activity-logs) and specify the following details:

    - **Target**. Specify the specific table with the raw data.
    - **Format**. Specify `.json` as the table format.
    - **Mapping to be applied**. Specify the mapping table created in [step 4](#mapping) above.

1. **Modify retention for the target table**. The [default Azure Data Explorer retention policy](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/retentionpolicy) may be far longer than you need.

    Use the following command to update the retention policy to one year:

    ```kusto
    .alter-merge table <tableName> policy retention softdelete = 365d recoverability = disabled
    ```

### [Azure Storage / Azure Data Factory](#tab/azure-storage-azure-data-factory)

This section describes how to export Microsoft Sentinel data from Log Analytics into Azure Storage, where Azure Data Factory can run a regular job to export the data into Azure Data Explorer.

Using Azure Storage and Azure Data Factory enables you to copy data from Azure Storage only when it's close to the retention limit in Microsoft Sentinel / Log Analytics. There is no data duplication, and Azure Data Explorer is used *only* to access data that's older than the retention limit in Microsoft Sentinel.

> [!TIP]
> While the architecture for using Azure Storage and Azure Data Factory for your legacy data is more complex, this method can offer larger cost savings overall.
>
The following image shows a sample flow of exported data into an Azure Storage, from where Azure Data Factory runs a regular job to further export it into Azure Data Explorer.

**To export data into Azure Data Explorer via an Azure Storage and Azure Data Factory**:

1. **Configure the Log Analytics data export to a Storage Account**. For more information, see [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export.md?tabs=portal#enable-data-export).

1. **Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database**. For more information, see:

    - [Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database](/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-database-portal)
    - [Select the correct compute SKU for your Azure Data Explorer cluster](/azure/data-explorer/manage-cluster-choose-sku)

    For more information, see [Connect an Event Hub to Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-no-code?tabs=activity-logs).

1. **Set up the Azure Data Factory pipeline**:

    - Create linked services for Azure Storage and Azure Data Explorer. For more information, see:

        - [Copy and transform data in Azure Blob storage by using Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/connector-azure-blob-storage.md)
        - [Copy data to or from Azure Data Explorer by using Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/connector-azure-data-explorer.md).

    - Create a dataset from Azure Storage. For more information, see [Datasets in Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/concepts-datasets-linked-services.md).

    - Create a data pipeline with a copy activity, based on when the blob properties were last modified. 

        This step requires an extra understanding of Azure Data Factory. For more information, see [Copy activity in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics](../data-factory/copy-activity-overview.md).

## Design considerations

When storing your Microsoft Sentinel data in Azure Data Explorer, consider the following elements:

|Consideration  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Cluster size and SKU**     | Plan carefully for the number of nodes and the VM SKU in your cluster. These factors will determine the amount of processing power and the size of your hot cache (SSD and memory). The bigger the cache, the more data you will be able to query at a higher performance. <br><br>We encourage you to visit the [Azure Data Explorer sizing calculator](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/AzureDataExplorerCostEstimator.html), where you can play with different configurations and see the resulting cost. <br><br>Azure Data Explorer also has an autoscale capability that makes intelligent decisions to add/remove nodes as needed based on cluster load. For more information, see [Manage cluster horizontal scaling (scale out) in Azure Data Explorer to accommodate changing demand](/azure/data-explorer/manage-cluster-horizontal-scaling).      |
|**Hot/cold cache**     | Azure Data Explorer provides control over the data tables that are in hot cache, and return results faster. If you have large amounts of data in your Azure Data Explorer cluster, you may want to break down tables by month, so that you have greater granularity on the data that's present in your hot cache. <br><br>For more information, see [Cache policy (hot and cold cache)](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/cachepolicy)       |
|**Retention**     |   In Azure Data Explorer, you can configure when data is removed from a database or an individual table, which is also an important part of limiting storage costs. <br><br> For more information, see [Retention policy](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/retentionpolicy).       |
|**Security**     |  Several Azure Data Explorer settings can help you protect your data, such as identity management, encryption, and so on. Specifically for role-based access control (RBAC), Azure Data Explorer can be configured to restrict access to databases, tables, or even rows within a table. For more information, see [Security in Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/security) and [Row level security](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/rowlevelsecuritypolicy).|
|**Data sharing**     |   Azure Data Explorer allows you to make pieces of data available to other parties, such as partners or vendors, and even buy data from other parties. For more information, see [Use Azure Data Share to share data with Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-share).      |
| **Other cost components** | Consider the other cost components for the following methods: <br><br>**Exporting  data via an Azure Event Hub**: <br>- Log Analytics data export costs, charged per exported GBs. <br>- Event hub costs, charged by throughput unit.  <br><br>**Export data via Azure Storage and Azure Data Factory**: <br>- Log Analytics data export, charged per exported GBs. <br>- Azure Storage, charged by GBs stored. <br>- Azure Data Factory, charged per copy of activities run.
|     |         |
