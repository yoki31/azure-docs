### Observed people tracing (preview)  

Azure Video Analyzer for Media now detects observed people in videos and provides information such as the location of the person in the video frame and the exact timestamp (start, end) when a person appears. The API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each person instance detected, including its confidence. 

For example, if a video contains a person, the detect operation will list the person appearances together with their coordinates in the video frames. You can use this functionality to determine the person path in a video. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same person in a video. 

The newly added observed people tracing feature is available when indexing your file by choosing the **Advanced option** -> **Advanced video** or **Advanced video + audio** preset (under Video + audio indexing). Standard  and basic indexing presets will not include this new advanced model. 

When you choose to see Insights of your video on the Video Analyzer for Media website, the Observed People Tracing will show up on the page with all detected people thumbnails. You can choose a thumbnail of a person and see where the person appears in the video player.  

The feature is also available in the JSON file generated by Video Analyzer for Media. For more information, see [Trace observed people in a video](observed-people-tracing.md).

### Detected acoustic events with **Audio Effects Detection** (preview)

You can now see the detected acoustic events in the closed captions file. The file can be downloaded from the Video Analyzer for Media portal and is available as an artifact in the GetArtifact API.

**Audio Effects Detection** (preview) component detects various acoustics events and classifies them into different acoustic categories (such as Gunshot, Screaming, Crowd Reaction and more). For more information, see [Audio effects detection](audio-effects-detection.md).

## March 2021

More information on the pricing, see the [Media Services pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/media-services/) page.

The newly added bundle is available when indexing or re-indexing your file by choosing the **Advanced option** -> **Basic Audio** preset (under the **Video + audio indexing** drop-down box).

### Prepare for upcoming changes

* Today, the following APIs return an account object:

    * [Create-Paid-Account](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Create-Paid-Account)
    * [Get-Account](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Account)
    * [Get-Accounts-Authorization](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Accounts-Authorization)
    * [Get-Accounts-With-Token](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Accounts-With-Token)
 
    The Account object has a `Url` field pointing to the location of the [Video Analyzer for Media website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/).
For paid accounts the `Url` field is currently pointing to an internal URL instead of the public website.
In the coming weeks we will change it and return the [Video Analyzer for Media website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) URL for all accounts (trial and paid).

    Do not use the internal URLs, you should be using the [Video Analyzer for Media public APIs](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/).
* If you are embedding Video Analyzer for Media URLs in your applications and the URLs are not pointing to the [Video Analyzer for Media website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) or the Video Analyzer for Media API endpoint (`https://api.videoindexer.ai`) but rather to a regional endpoint (for example, `https://wus2.videoindexer.ai`), regenerate the URLs.

   You can do it by either:

    * Replacing the URL with a URL pointing to the Video Analyzer for Media widget APIs (for example, the [insights widget](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Video-Insights-Widget))
    * Using the Video Analyzer for Media website to generate a new embedded URL:
         
         Press **Play** to get to your video's page -> click the **&lt;/&gt; Embed** button -> copy the URL into your application:
   
    The regional URLs are not supported and will be blocked in the coming weeks.
