# Azure Policy for Video Analyzer

Azure Video Analyzer provides several built-in [Azure Policy](../../governance/policy/overview.md) definitions to help enforce organizational standards and compliance at-scale. Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost and management. 

Video Analyzer provides several common use case definitions for Azure Policy that are built-in to help you get started. This article explains how to assign policies for a Video Analyzer account using the Azure portal. 

## Built-in Azure Policy definitions 

The following built-in policy definitions are available for use with Video Analyzer. 

|Name<br /><sub>(Azure portal)</sub> |Description |Effect(s) |Version<br /><sub>(GitHub)</sub> |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Video Analyzer accounts should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F165a4137-c3ed-4fd0-a17f-1c8a80266580) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Video Analyzer accounts. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.
