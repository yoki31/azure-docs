# Bindings for Durable Functions (Azure Functions)

The [Durable Functions](durable-functions-overview.md) extension introduces three trigger bindings that control the execution of orchestrator, entity, and activity functions. It also introduces an output binding that acts as a client for the Durable Functions runtime.

## Orchestration trigger

The orchestration trigger enables you to author [durable orchestrator functions](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#orchestrator-functions). This trigger executes when a new orchestration instance is scheduled and when an existing orchestration instance receives an event. Examples of events that can trigger orchestrator functions include durable timer expirations, activity function responses, and events raised by external clients.

When you author functions in .NET, the orchestration trigger is configured using the [OrchestrationTriggerAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.orchestrationtriggerattribute) .NET attribute.

When you write orchestrator functions in scripting languages, like JavaScript, Python, or PowerShell, the orchestration trigger is defined by the following JSON object in the `bindings` array of the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "name": "<Name of input parameter in function signature>",
    "orchestration": "<Optional - name of the orchestration>",
    "type": "orchestrationTrigger",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

* `orchestration` is the name of the orchestration that clients must use when they want to start new instances of this orchestrator function. This property is optional. If not specified, the name of the function is used.

Internally, this trigger binding polls the configured durable store for new orchestration events, such as orchestration start events, durable timer expiration events, activity function response events, and external events raised by other functions.

### Trigger behavior

Here are some notes about the orchestration trigger:

* **Single-threading** - A single dispatcher thread is used for all orchestrator function execution on a single host instance. For this reason, it's important to ensure that orchestrator function code is efficient and doesn't perform any I/O. It is also important to ensure that this thread does not do any async work except when awaiting on Durable Functions-specific task types.
* **Poison-message handling** - There's no poison message support in orchestration triggers.
* **Message visibility** - Orchestration trigger messages are dequeued and kept invisible for a configurable duration. The visibility of these messages is renewed automatically as long as the function app is running and healthy.
* **Return values** - Return values are serialized to JSON and persisted to the orchestration history table in Azure Table storage. These return values can be queried by the orchestration client binding, described later.

> [!WARNING]
> Orchestrator functions should never use any input or output bindings other than the orchestration trigger binding. Doing so has the potential to cause problems with the Durable Task extension because those bindings may not obey the single-threading and I/O rules. If you'd like to use other bindings, add them to an activity function called from your orchestrator function. For more information about coding constraints for orchestrator functions, see the [Orchestrator function code constraints](durable-functions-code-constraints.md) documentation.

> [!WARNING]
> JavaScript and Python orchestrator functions should never be declared `async`.

### Trigger usage

The orchestration trigger binding supports both inputs and outputs. Here are some things to know about input and output handling:

* **inputs** - Orchestration triggers can be invoked with inputs, which are accessed through the context input object. All inputs must be JSON-serializable.
* **outputs** - Orchestration triggers support output values as well as inputs. The return value of the function is used to assign the output value and must be JSON-serializable.

### Trigger sample

The following example code shows what the simplest "Hello World" orchestrator function might look like:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
[FunctionName("HelloWorld")]
public static string Run([OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    string name = context.GetInput<string>();
    // ... do some work ...
    return $"Hello {name}!";
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The previous code is for Durable Functions 2.x. For Durable Functions 1.x, you must use `DurableOrchestrationContext` instead of `IDurableOrchestrationContext`. For more information about the differences between versions, see the [Durable Functions Versions](durable-functions-versions.md) article.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
const df = require("durable-functions");

module.exports = df.orchestrator(function*(context) {
    const name = context.df.getInput();
    // ... do some work ...
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `durable-functions` library takes care of calling the `context.done` method when the generator function exits.

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
import azure.durable_functions as df

def orchestrator_function(context: df.DurableOrchestrationContext):
    input = context.get_input()
    # Do some work
    return f"Hello {input['name']}!"

main = df.Orchestrator.create(orchestrator_function)
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
param($Context)

$input = $Context.Input

# Do some work

$output
```
---

Most orchestrator functions call activity functions, so here is a "Hello World" example that demonstrates how to call an activity function:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
[FunctionName("HelloWorld")]
public static async Task<string> Run(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    string name = context.GetInput<string>();
    string result = await context.CallActivityAsync<string>("SayHello", name);
    return result;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The previous code is for Durable Functions 2.x. For Durable Functions 1.x, you must use `DurableOrchestrationContext` instead of `IDurableOrchestrationContext`. For more information about the differences between versions, see the [Durable Functions versions](durable-functions-versions.md) article.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
const df = require("durable-functions");

module.exports = df.orchestrator(function*(context) {
    const name = context.df.getInput();
    const result = yield context.df.callActivity("SayHello", name);
    return result;
});
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
import azure.durable_functions as df

def orchestrator_function(context: df.DurableOrchestrationContext):
    input = context.get_input()
    result = yield context.call_activity('SayHello', input['name'])
    return result

main = df.Orchestrator.create(orchestrator_function)
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
param($Context)

$name = $Context.Input.Name

$output = Invoke-DurableActivity -FunctionName 'SayHello' -Input $name

$output
```

---

## Activity trigger

The activity trigger enables you to author functions that are called by orchestrator functions, known as [activity functions](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#activity-functions).

If you're authoring functions in .NET, the activity trigger is configured using the [ActivityTriggerAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.activitytriggerattribute) .NET attribute.

If you're using JavaScript, Python, or PowerShell, the activity trigger is defined by the following JSON object in the `bindings` array of *function.json*:

```json
{
    "name": "<Name of input parameter in function signature>",
    "activity": "<Optional - name of the activity>",
    "type": "activityTrigger",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

* `activity` is the name of the activity. This value is the name that orchestrator functions use to invoke this activity function. This property is optional. If not specified, the name of the function is used.

Internally, this trigger binding polls the configured durable store for new activity execution events.

### Trigger behavior

Here are some notes about the activity trigger:

* **Threading** - Unlike the orchestration trigger, activity triggers don't have any restrictions around threading or I/O. They can be treated like regular functions.
* **Poison-message handling** - There's no poison message support in activity triggers.
* **Message visibility** - Activity trigger messages are dequeued and kept invisible for a configurable duration. The visibility of these messages is renewed automatically as long as the function app is running and healthy.
* **Return values** - Return values are serialized to JSON and persisted to the configured durable store.

### Trigger usage

The activity trigger binding supports both inputs and outputs, just like the orchestration trigger. Here are some things to know about input and output handling:

* **inputs** - Activity triggers can be invoked with inputs from an orchestrator function. All inputs must be JSON-serializable.
* **outputs** - Activity functions support output values as well as inputs. The return value of the function is used to assign the output value and must be JSON-serializable.
* **metadata** - .NET activity functions can bind to a `string instanceId` parameter to get the instance ID of the calling orchestration.

### Trigger sample

The following example code shows what a simple `SayHello` activity function might look like:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
[FunctionName("SayHello")]
public static string SayHello([ActivityTrigger] IDurableActivityContext helloContext)
{
    string name = helloContext.GetInput<string>();
    return $"Hello {name}!";
}
```

The default parameter type for the .NET `ActivityTriggerAttribute` binding is [IDurableActivityContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.idurableactivitycontext) (or [DurableActivityContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.durableactivitycontext?view=azure-dotnet-legacy&preserve-view=true) for Durable Functions v1). However, .NET activity triggers also support binding directly to JSON-serializeable types (including primitive types), so the same function could be simplified as follows:

```csharp
[FunctionName("SayHello")]
public static string SayHello([ActivityTrigger] string name)
{
    return $"Hello {name}!";
}
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
module.exports = async function(context) {
    return `Hello ${context.bindings.name}!`;
};
```

JavaScript bindings can also be passed in as additional parameters, so the same function could be simplified as follows:

```javascript
module.exports = async function(context, name) {
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
};
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
def main(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}!"
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
```powershell
param($name)

"Hello $name!"
```
---

### Using input and output bindings

You can use regular input and output bindings in addition to the activity trigger binding. For example, you can take the input to your activity binding, and send a message to an EventHub using the EventHub output binding:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "message",
      "type": "activityTrigger",
      "direction": "in"
    },
    {
      "type": "eventHub",
      "name": "outputEventHubMessage",
      "connection": "EventhubConnectionSetting",
      "eventHubName": "eh_messages",
      "direction": "out"
  }
  ]
}
```

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context) {
    context.bindings.outputEventHubMessage = context.bindings.message;
};
```

## Orchestration client

The orchestration client binding enables you to write functions that interact with orchestrator functions. These functions are often referred to as [client functions](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#client-functions). For example, you can act on orchestration instances in the following ways:

* Start them.
* Query their status.
* Terminate them.
* Send events to them while they're running.
* Purge instance history.

If you're using .NET, you can bind to the orchestration client by using the [DurableClientAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.durableclientattribute) attribute ([OrchestrationClientAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.orchestrationclientattribute?view=azure-dotnet-legacy&preserve-view=true) in Durable Functions v1.x).

If you're using scripting languages, like JavaScript, Python, or PowerShell, the durable client trigger is defined by the following JSON object in the `bindings` array of *function.json*:

```json
{
    "name": "<Name of input parameter in function signature>",
    "taskHub": "<Optional - name of the task hub>",
    "connectionName": "<Optional - name of the connection string app setting>",
    "type": "orchestrationClient",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

* `taskHub` - Used in scenarios where multiple function apps share the same storage account but need to be isolated from each other. If not specified, the default value from `host.json` is used. This value must match the value used by the target orchestrator functions.
* `connectionName` - The name of an app setting that contains a storage account connection string. The storage account represented by this connection string must be the same one used by the target orchestrator functions. If not specified, the default storage account connection string for the function app is used.

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases, we recommend that you omit these properties and rely on the default behavior.

### Client usage

In .NET functions, you typically bind to [IDurableClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.idurableclient) ([DurableOrchestrationClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.durableorchestrationclient?view=azure-dotnet-legacy&preserve-view=true) in Durable Functions v1.x), which gives you full access to all orchestration client APIs supported by Durable Functions. In other languages, you must use the language-specific SDK to get access to a client object.

Here's an example queue-triggered function that starts a "HelloWorld" orchestration.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
[FunctionName("QueueStart")]
public static Task Run(
    [QueueTrigger("durable-function-trigger")] string input,
    [DurableClient] IDurableOrchestrationClient starter)
{
    // Orchestration input comes from the queue message content.
    return starter.StartNewAsync("HelloWorld", input);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The previous C# code is for Durable Functions 2.x. For Durable Functions 1.x, you must use `OrchestrationClient` attribute instead of the `DurableClient` attribute, and you must use the `DurableOrchestrationClient` parameter type instead of `IDurableOrchestrationClient`. For more information about the differences between versions, see the [Durable Functions Versions](durable-functions-versions.md) article.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

**function.json**
```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "queueName": "durable-function-trigger",
      "direction": "in"
    },
    {
      "name": "starter",
      "type": "durableClient",
      "direction": "in"
    }
  ]
}
```

**index.js**
```javascript
const df = require("durable-functions");

module.exports = async function (context) {
    const client = df.getClient(context);
    return instanceId = await client.startNew("HelloWorld", undefined, context.bindings.input);
};
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

**function.json**
```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "queueName": "durable-function-trigger",
      "direction": "in"
    },
    {
      "name": "starter",
      "type": "durableClient",
      "direction": "in"
    }
  ]
}
```

**__init__.py**
```python
import json
import azure.functions as func
import azure.durable_functions as df

async def main(msg: func.QueueMessage, starter: str) -> None:
    client = df.DurableOrchestrationClient(starter)
    payload = msg.get_body().decode('utf-8')
    instance_id = await client.start_new("HelloWorld", client_input=payload)
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

**function.json**
```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "input",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "queueName": "durable-function-trigger",
      "direction": "in"
    },
    {
      "name": "starter",
      "type": "durableClient",
      "direction": "in"
    }
  ]
}
```

**run.ps1**
```powershell
param($[string] $input, $TriggerMetadata)

$InstanceId = Start-DurableOrchestration -FunctionName $FunctionName -Input $input
```

More details on starting instances can be found in [Instance management](durable-functions-instance-management.md).

## Entity trigger

Entity triggers allow you to author [entity functions](durable-functions-entities.md). This trigger supports processing events for a specific entity instance.

> [!NOTE]
> Entity triggers are available starting in Durable Functions 2.x.

Internally, this trigger binding polls the configured durable store for new entity operations that need to be executed.

If you're authoring functions in .NET, the entity trigger is configured using the [EntityTriggerAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.entitytriggerattribute) .NET attribute.

If you're using JavaScript, Python, or PowerShell, the entity trigger is defined by the following JSON object in the `bindings` array of *function.json*:

```json
{
    "name": "<Name of input parameter in function signature>",
    "entityName": "<Optional - name of the entity>",
    "type": "entityTrigger",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

By default, the name of an entity is the name of the function.

### Trigger behavior

Here are some notes about the entity trigger:

* **Single-threaded**: A single dispatcher thread is used to process operations for a particular entity. If multiple messages are sent to a single entity concurrently, the operations will be processed one-at-a-time.
* **Poison-message handling** - There's no poison message support in entity triggers.
* **Message visibility** - Entity trigger messages are dequeued and kept invisible for a configurable duration. The visibility of these messages is renewed automatically as long as the function app is running and healthy.
* **Return values** - Entity functions don't support return values. There are specific APIs that can be used to save state or pass values back to orchestrations.

Any state changes made to an entity during its execution will be automatically persisted after execution has completed.

For more information and examples on defining and interacting with entity triggers, see the [Durable Entities](durable-functions-entities.md) documentation.

## Entity client

The entity client binding enables you to asynchronously trigger [entity functions](#entity-trigger). These functions are sometimes referred to as [client functions](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#client-functions).

If you're using .NET precompiled functions, you can bind to the entity client by using the [DurableClientAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.durableclientattribute) .NET attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> The `[DurableClientAttribute]` can also be used to bind to the [orchestration client](#orchestration-client).

If you're using scripting languages (like C# scripting, JavaScript, or Python) for development, the entity trigger is defined by the following JSON object in the `bindings` array of *function.json*:

```json
{
    "name": "<Name of input parameter in function signature>",
    "taskHub": "<Optional - name of the task hub>",
    "connectionName": "<Optional - name of the connection string app setting>",
    "type": "durableClient",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

* `taskHub` - Used in scenarios where multiple function apps share the same storage account but need to be isolated from each other. If not specified, the default value from `host.json` is used. This value must match the value used by the target entity functions.
* `connectionName` - The name of an app setting that contains a storage account connection string. The storage account represented by this connection string must be the same one used by the target entity functions. If not specified, the default storage account connection string for the function app is used.

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases, we recommend that you omit the optional properties and rely on the default behavior.

For more information and examples on interacting with entities as a client, see the [Durable Entities](durable-functions-entities.md#access-entities) documentation.
