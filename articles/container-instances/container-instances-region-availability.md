# Resource availability for Azure Container Instances in Azure regions

This article details the availability of Azure Container Instances compute, memory, and storage resources in Azure regions and by target operating system. For a general list of available regions for Azure Container Instances, see [available regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).

Values presented are the maximum resources available per deployment of a [container group](container-instances-container-groups.md). Values are current at time of publication.

> [!NOTE]
> Container groups created within these resource limits are subject to availability within the deployment region. When a region is under heavy load, you may experience a failure when deploying instances. To mitigate such a deployment failure, try deploying instances with lower resource settings, or try your deployment at a later time or in a different region with available resources.

For information about quotas and other limits in your deployments, see [Quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).

## Linux container groups

The following regions and maximum resources are available to container groups with Linux containers in general deployments, [Azure virtual network](container-instances-vnet.md) deployments, and deployments with [GPU resources](container-instances-gpu.md) (preview).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The maximum resources in a region are different depending on your deployment. For example, a region may have a different maximum CPU and memory size in an Azure virtual network deployment than for a general deployment. That same region may also have a different set of maximum values for a deployment with GPU resources. Verify your deployment type before checking the below tables for the maximum values in your region.

> [!NOTE]
> Some regions don't support availability zones (denoted by a 'N/A' in the table below), and some regions have availability zones, but ACI doesn't currently leverage the capability (denoted by an 'N' in the table below). For more information, see [Azure regions with availability zones][az-region-support].
