# How to connect AWS and Azure using a BGP-enabled VPN gateway

This article walks you through the setup of a BGP-enabled connection between Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). You'll use an Azure VPN gateway with BGP and active-active enabled and an AWS virtual private gateway with two site-to-site connections.

## <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture
In this setup, you'll create the following resources:

Azure
* One virtual network
* One virtual network gateway with active-active and BGP enabled 
* Four local network gateways
* Four site-to-site connections 

AWS
* One virtual private cloud (VPC)
* One virtual private gateway
* Two customer gateways
* Two site-to-site connections, each with two tunnels (total of four tunnels)

A site-to-site connection on AWS has two tunnels, each with their own outside IP address and inside IPv4 CIDR (used for BGP APIPA). An active-passive VPN gateway only supports **one** custom BGP APIPA. You'll need to enable **active-active** on your Azure VPN gateway to connect to multiple AWS tunnels. 

On the AWS side, you'll create a customer gateway and site-to-site connection for **each of the two Azure VPN gateway instances** (total of four outgoing tunnels). In Azure, you'll need to create four local network gateways and four connections to receive these four AWS tunnels.

## <a name="apipa-config"></a> Choosing BGP APIPA Addresses

You can use the values below for your BGP APIPA configuration throughout the tutorial.

| **Tunnel**                           | **Azure Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP Address** | **AWS BGP Peer IP Address** |  **AWS Inside IPv4 CIDR** |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------   | --------------------------|
| **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0** | 169.254.21.2                                | 169.254.21.1                 | 169.254.21.0/30            |
| **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0** | 169.254.22.2                                | 169.254.22.1                 | 169.254.22.0/30            |
| **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1** | 169.254.21.6                                | 169.254.21.5                 | 169.254.21.4/30            |
| **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1** | 169.254.22.6                                | 169.254.22.5                 | 169.254.22.4/30            |

You can also set up your own custom APIPA addresses. AWS requires a /30 **Inside IPv4 CIDR** in the APIPA range of **169.254.0.0/16** for each tunnel. This CIDR must also be in the Azure-reserved APIPA range for VPN, which is from **169.254.21.0** to **169.254.22.255**. AWS will use the first IP address of your /30 inside CIDR and Azure will use the second. This means you'll need to reserve space for two IP addresses in your AWS /30 CIDR.

For example, if you set your AWS **Inside IPv4 CIDR** to be **169.254.21.0/30**, AWS will use the BGP IP address **169.254.21.1** and Azure will use the IP address **169.254.21.2**. 
   >
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > Your APIPA addresses must not overlap between the on-premises VPN devices and all connected Azure VPN gateways.

    - Under Public IP Address, select **Enabled** for **Enable active-active mode**.
    - Specify names for the first and second **Public IP address name**. These settings specify the public IP address object that gets associated to the VPN gateway. The public IP address is dynamically assigned to this object when the VPN gateway is created. 
4. Configure BGP

    :::image type="content" source="./media/vpn-gateway-howto-aws-bgp/create-gw-bgp.png" alt-text="BGP for creating gateway" :::
    - Select **Enabled** for **Configure BGP** to show the BGP configuration section.
    - Fill in a **ASN (Autonomous System Number)**. This ASN must be different than the ASN used by AWS.
    - Add two addresses to **Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address**. Include the IP addresses for **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0** and **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0** from the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). The second input will only appear after you add your first APIPA BGP IP address.
    - Add two addresses to **Second Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address**. Include the IP addresses for **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1** and **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1** from the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). The second input will only appear after you add your first APIPA BGP IP address.
6. Select **Review + create** to run validation. Once validation passes, select **Create** to deploy the VPN gateway. Creating a gateway can often take 45 minutes or more, depending on the selected gateway SKU. You can see the deployment status on the Overview page for your gateway.
