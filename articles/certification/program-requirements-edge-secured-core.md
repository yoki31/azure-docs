# Azure Certified Device - Edge Secured-core (Preview) #

## Edge Secured-Core certification requirements ##

### Program purpose ###
Edge Secured-core is an incremental certification in the Azure Certified Device program for IoT devices running a full operating system, such as Linux or Windows 10 IoT.This program enables device partners to differentiate their devices by meeting an additional set of security criteria. Devices meeting this criteria enable these promises:

1. Hardware-based device identity 
2. Capable of enforcing system integrity 
3. Stays up to date and is remotely manageable
4. Provides data at-rest protection
5. Provides data in-transit protection
6. Built in security agent and hardening

## Preview Program Support
While in public preview, we are supporting a small number of partners to pre-validate devices against the Edge Secured-core program requirements.  If you would like participate in the Edge Secured-core public preview, please contact iotcert@microsoft.com

Overview content
::: zone pivot="platform-windows"

## Windows IoT OS Support
Edge Secured-core for Windows IoT requires Windows 10 IoT Enterprise version 1903 or greater
* [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise Lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/windows-10-iot-enterprise)
> [!Note]
> The Windows secured-core tests require you to download and run the following package (https://aka.ms/Scforwiniot) from an Administrator Command Prompt on the IoT device being validated.

## Windows IoT Hardware/Firmware Requirements
> [!Note]
> Hardware must support and have the following enabled:
> * Intel or AMD virtualization extensions
> * Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0
> * <b>For Intel systems:</b> Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d), Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), and SINIT ACM driver package must be included in the Windows system image (for DRTM)
> * <b>For AMD systems:</b> AMD IOMMU and AMD-V virtualization, and SKINIT package must be integrated in the Windows system image (for DRTM)
> * Kernel DMA Protection (also known as Memory Access Protection)

## Linux OS Support
OS Support is determined through underlying requirements of Azure services and our ability to validate scenarios.

The Edge Secured-core program for Linux is enabled through the IoT Edge runtime which is supported based on [Tier 1 and Tier 2 operating systems](../iot-edge/support.md).

## IoT Edge
Edge Secured-core validation on Linux based devices is executed through a container run on the IoT Edge runtime. For this reason, all devices that are certifying Edge Secured-core must have the IoT Edge runtime installed.

## Linux Hardware/Firmware Requirements
>[!Note]
> * Hardware must support TPM v2.0, SRTM, Secure-boot or UBoot.
> * Firmware will be submitted to Microsoft for vulnerability and configuration evaluation.
