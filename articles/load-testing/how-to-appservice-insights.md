# Get detailed insights from App Service diagnostics and Azure Load Testing Preview for Azure App Service workloads

In this article, you'll learn how to gain more insights from Azure App Service workloads by using Azure Load Testing Preview and Azure App Service diagnostics.

[App Service diagnostics](../app-service/overview-diagnostics.md) is an intelligent and interactive way to help troubleshoot your app, with no configuration required. When you run into issues with your app, App Service diagnostics can help you resolve the issue easily and quickly.

You can take advantage of App Service diagnostics when you run load tests on applications that run on App Service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Load Testing is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
- An Azure Load Testing resource. If you need to create an Azure Load Testing resource, see the quickstart [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md).
- An Azure App Service workload that you're running a load test against and that you've added to the app components to monitor during the load test.

## Get more insights when you test an App Service workload  

In this section, you use [App Service diagnostics](../app-service/overview-diagnostics.md) to get more insights from load testing an Azure App Service workload.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your Azure Load Testing resource.

1. On the left pane, select **Tests** to view the list of tests, and then select your test.

1. On the test runs page, select **Configure**, and then select **App Components** to add or remove Azure resources to monitor during the load test.
