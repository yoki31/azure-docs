# Support matrix for Azure VM disaster recovery between Azure regions

This article summarizes support and prerequisites for disaster recovery of Azure VMs from one Azure region to another, using the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service.


## Deployment method support

**Deployment** |  **Support**
--- | ---
**Azure portal** | Supported.
**PowerShell** | Supported. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-powershell.md)
**REST API** | Supported.
**CLI** | Not currently supported


## Resource move/migrate support

**Resource action** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Move vaults across resource groups** | Not supported
**Move compute/storage/network resources across resource groups** | Not supported.<br/><br/> If you move a VM or associated components such as storage/network after the VM is replicating, you need to disable and then re-enable replication for the VM.
**Replicate Azure VMs from one subscription to another for disaster recovery** | Supported within the same Azure Active Directory tenant.
**Migrate VMs across regions within supported geographical clusters (within and across subscriptions)** | Supported within the same Azure Active Directory tenant.
**Migrate VMs within the same region** | Not supported.
**Azure Dedicated Hosts** | Not supported.

## Region support

Azure Site Recovery allows you to perform global disaster recovery. You can replicate and recover VMs between any two Azure regions in the world. If you have concerns around data sovereignty, you may choose to limit replication within your specific geographic cluster. The various geographic clusters are as follows:

**Geographic cluster** | **Azure regions**
-- | --
America | Canada East, Canada Central, South Central US, West Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, West US 3, Central US, North Central US
Europe | UK West, UK South, North Europe, West Europe, South Africa West, South Africa North, Norway East, France Central, Switzerland North, Germany West Central, UAE North, UAE Central (UAE is treated as part of the Europe geo cluster)
Asia | South India, Central India, West India, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Korea South
JIO | JIO India West
Australia    | Australia East, Australia Southeast, Australia Central, Australia Central 2
Azure Government    | US GOV Virginia, US GOV Iowa, US GOV Arizona, US GOV Texas, US DOD East, US DOD Central
Germany    | Germany Central, Germany Northeast
China | China East, China North, China North2, China East2
Brazil | Brazil South
Restricted Regions reserved for in-country disaster recovery |Switzerland West reserved for Switzerland North, France South reserved for France Central, Norway West for Norway East customers, JIO India Central for JIO India West customers, Brazil Southeast for Brazil South customers, South Africa West for South Africa North customers, Germany North for Germany West Central customers.

>[!NOTE]
>
> - For **Brazil South**, you can replicate and fail over to these regions: Brazil Southeast, South Central US, West Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, and North Central US.
> - Brazil South can only be used as a source region from which VMs can replicate using Site Recovery. It can't act as a target region. Note that if you fail over from Brazil South as a source region to a target, failback to Brazil South from the target region is supported. Brazil Southeast can only be used as a target region.
> - If the region in which you want to create a vault doesn't show, make sure your subscription has access to create resources in that region.
> - If you can't see a region within a geographic cluster when you enable replication, make sure your subscription has permissions to create VMs in that region.

## Cache storage

This table summarizes support for the cache storage account used by Site Recovery during replication.

**Setting** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
General purpose V2 storage accounts (Hot and Cool tier) | Supported | Usage of GPv2 is not recommended because transaction costs for V2 are substantially higher than V1 storage accounts.
Premium storage | Not supported | Standard storage accounts are used for cache storage, to help optimize costs.
Region |  Same region as virtual machine  | Cache storage account should be in the same region as the virtual machine being protected.
Subscription  | Can be different from source virtual machines | Cache storage account need not be in the same subscription as the source virtual machine(s).
Azure Storage firewalls for virtual networks  | Supported | If you are using firewall enabled cache storage account or target storage account, ensure you ['Allow trusted Microsoft services'](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#exceptions).<br></br>Also, ensure that you allow access to at least one subnet of source Vnet.<br></br>Note: Do not restrict virtual network access to your storage accounts used for Site Recovery. You should allow access from 'All networks'.
Soft delete | Not supported | Soft delete is not supported because once it is enabled on cache storage account, it increases cost. ASR performs very frequent creates/deletes of log files while replicating causing costs to increase.
Encryption at rest (CMK) | Supported | Storage account encryption can be configured with customer managed keys (CMK)

The table below lists the limits in terms of number of disks that can replicate to a single storage account.

**Storage account type**    |    **Churn = 4 MBps per disk**    |    **Churn = 8 MBps per disk**
---    |    ---    |    ---
V1 storage account    |    300 disks    |    150 disks
V2 storage account    |    750 disks    |    375 disks

As average churn on the disks increases, the number of disks that a storage account can support decreases. The above table may be used as a guide for making decisions on number of storage accounts that need to be provisioned.

Please note that the above limits are specific to Azure-to-Azure and Zone-to-Zone DR scenarios.

## Replicated machine operating systems

Site Recovery supports replication of Azure VMs running the operating systems listed in this section. Note that if an already-replicating machine is later upgraded (or downgraded) to a different major kernel, you need to disable replication and re-enable replication after the upgrade.

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux versions, Azure Site Recovery does not support custom OS kernels. Only the stock kernels that are part of the distribution minor version release/update are supported.

**Note: To support latest Linux kernels within 15 days of release, Azure Site Recovery rolls out hot fix patch on top of latest mobility agent version. This fix is rolled out in between two major version releases. To update to latest version of mobility agent (including hot fix patch), follow steps mentioned in [this article](service-updates-how-to.md#azure-vm-disaster-recovery-to-azure). This patch is currently rolled out for mobility agents used in Azure to Azure DR scenario.

**Note: To support latest Linux kernels within 15 days of release, Azure Site Recovery rolls out hot fix patch on top of latest mobility agent version. This fix is rolled out in between two major version releases. To update to latest version of mobility agent (including hot fix patch) follow steps mentioned in [this article](service-updates-how-to.md#azure-vm-disaster-recovery-to-azure). This patch is currently rolled out for mobility agents used in Azure to Azure DR scenario.

**Note: For Ubuntu 20.04, we had initially rolled out support for kernels 5.8.* but we have since found issues with support for this kernel and hence have redacted these kernels from our support statement for the time being.

## Replicated machines - compute settings

**Setting** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
Size | Any Azure VM size with at least two CPU cores and 1-GB RAM | Verify [Azure virtual machine sizes](../virtual-machines/sizes.md).
RAM | Azure Site Recovery driver consumes 6% of RAM.
Availability sets | Supported | If you enable replication for an Azure VM with the default options, an availability set is created automatically, based on the source region settings. You can modify these settings.
Availability zones | Supported |
Dedicated Hosts | Not supported |
Hybrid Use Benefit (HUB) | Supported | If the source VM has a HUB license enabled, a test failover or failed over VM also uses the HUB license.
VMSS Flex | Availability scenario - supported. Scalability scenario - not supported. |
Azure gallery images - Microsoft published | Supported | Supported if the VM runs on a supported operating system.
Azure Gallery images - Third party published | Supported | Supported if the VM runs on a supported operating system.
Custom images - Third party published | Supported | Supported if the VM runs on a supported operating system.
VMs migrated using Site Recovery | Supported | If a VMware VM or physical machine was migrated to Azure using Site Recovery, you need to uninstall the older version of Mobility service running on the machine, and restart the machine before replicating it to another Azure region.
Azure RBAC policies | Not supported | Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) policies on VMs are not replicated to the failover VM in target region.
Extensions | Not supported | Extensions are not replicated to the failover VM in target region. It needs to be installed manually after failover.
Proximity Placement Groups | Supported | Virtual machines located inside a Proximity Placement Group can be protected using Site Recovery.
Tags  | Supported | User-generated tags applied on source virtual machines are carried over to target virtual machines post-test failover or failover. Tags on the VM(s) are replicated once every 24 hours for as long as the VM(s) is/are present in the target region.


## Replicated machines - disk actions

**Action** | **Details**
-- | ---
Resize disk on replicated VM | Resizing up on the source VM is supported. Resizing down on the source VM is not supported. Resizing should be performed before failover. No need to disable/re-enable replication.<br/><br/> If you change the source VM after failover, the changes aren't captured.<br/><br/> If you change the disk size on the Azure VM after failover, changes aren't captured by Site Recovery, and failback will be to the original VM size.<br/><br/> If resizing to >=4 TB, please note Azure guidance on disk caching [here](../virtual-machines/premium-storage-performance.md). 
Add a disk to a replicated VM | Supported
Offline changes to protected disks | Disconnecting disks and making offline modifications to them require triggering a full resync.
Disk caching | Disk Caching is not supported for disks 4 TiB and larger. If multiple disks are attached to your VM, each disk that is smaller than 4 TiB will support caching. Changing the cache setting of an Azure disk detaches and re-attaches the target disk. If it is the operating system disk, the VM is restarted. Stop all applications/services that might be affected by this disruption before changing the disk cache setting. Not following those recommendations could lead to data corruption.

## Replicated machines - storage

This table summarized support for the Azure VM OS disk, data disk, and temporary disk.

- It's important to observe the VM disk limits and targets for [managed disks](../virtual-machines/disks-scalability-targets.md) to avoid any performance issues.
- If you deploy with the default settings, Site Recovery automatically creates disks and storage accounts based on the source settings.
- If you customize, ensure you follow the guidelines.

**Component** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
OS disk maximum size | 4096 GB | [Learn more](../virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.md) about VM disks.
Temporary disk | Not supported | The temporary disk is always excluded from replication.<br/><br/> Don't store any persistent data on the temporary disk. [Learn more](../virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.md).

Soft delete | Not supported | Soft delete is not supported because once it is enabled on a storage account, it increases cost. ASR performs very frequent creates/deletes of log files while replicating causing costs to increase.
iSCSI disks | Not supported | ASR may be used to migrate or failover iSCSI disks into Azure. However, iSCSI disks are not supported for Azure to Azure replication and failover/failback.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid performance issues, make sure that you follow VM disk scalability and performance targets for [managed disks](../virtual-machines/disks-scalability-targets.md). If you use default settings, Site Recovery creates the required disks and storage accounts, based on the source configuration. If you customize and select your own settings,follow the disk scalability and performance targets for your source VMs.

## Limits and data change rates

The following table summarizes Site Recovery limits.

- These limits are based on our tests, but obviously don't cover all possible application I/O combinations.
- Actual results can vary based on your app I/O mix.
- There are two limits to consider, per disk data churn and per virtual machine data churn.
- The current limit for per virtual machine data churn is 54 MB/s, regardless of size.

**Storage target** | **Average source disk I/O** |**Average source disk data churn** | **Total source disk data churn per day**
---|---|---|---
Standard storage | 8 KB    | 2 MB/s | 168 GB per disk
Premium P10 or P15 disk | 8 KB    | 2 MB/s | 168 GB per disk
Premium P10 or P15 disk | 16 KB | 4 MB/s |    336 GB per disk
Premium P10 or P15 disk | 32 KB or greater | 8 MB/s | 672 GB per disk
Premium P20 or P30 or P40 or P50 disk | 8 KB    | 5 MB/s | 421 GB per disk
Premium P20 or P30 or P40 or P50 disk | 16 KB or greater |20 MB/s | 1684 GB per disk

## Replicated machines - networking
**Setting** | **Support** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
NIC | Maximum number supported for a specific Azure VM size | NICs are created when the VM is created during failover.<br/><br/> The number of NICs on the failover VM depends on the number of NICs on the source VM when replication was enabled. If you add or remove a NIC after enabling replication, it doesn't impact the number of NICs on the replicated VM after failover. <br/><br/> The order of NICs after failover is not guaranteed to be the same as the original order. <br/><br/> You can rename NICs in the target region based on your organization's naming conventions. NIC renaming is supported using PowerShell.
Internet Load Balancer | Not supported | You can set up public/internet load balancers in the primary region. However, public/internet load balancers are not supported by Azure Site Recovery in the DR region.
Internal Load balancer | Supported | Associate the preconfigured load balancer using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
Public IP address | Supported | Associate an existing public IP address with the NIC. Or, create a public IP address and associate it with the NIC using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
NSG on NIC | Supported | Associate the NSG with the NIC using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
NSG on subnet | Supported | Associate the NSG with the subnet using an Azure Automation script in a recovery plan.
Reserved (static) IP address | Supported | If the NIC on the source VM has a static IP address, and the target subnet has the same IP address available, it's assigned to the failed over VM.<br/><br/> If the target subnet doesn't have the same IP address available, one of the available IP addresses in the subnet is reserved for the VM.<br/><br/> You can also specify a fixed IP address and subnet in **Replicated items** > **Settings** > **Network** > **Network interfaces**.
Dynamic IP address | Supported | If the NIC on the source has dynamic IP addressing, the NIC on the failed over VM is also dynamic by default.<br/><br/> You can modify this to a fixed IP address if required.
Multiple IP addresses | Supported | When you fail over a VM that has a NIC with multiple IP addresses, only the primary IP address of the NIC in the source region is kept by default. To failover Secondary IP Configurations, go to the **Network** blade and configure them.
Traffic Manager     | Supported | You can preconfigure Traffic Manager so that traffic is routed to the endpoint in the source region on a regular basis, and to the endpoint in the target region in case of failover.
Azure DNS | Supported |
Custom DNS    | Supported |
Unauthenticated proxy | Supported | [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md)
Authenticated Proxy | Not supported | If the VM is using an authenticated proxy for outbound connectivity, it cannot be replicated using Azure Site Recovery.
VPN site-to-site connection to on-premises<br/><br/>(with or without ExpressRoute)| Supported | Ensure that the UDRs and NSGs are configured in such a way that the Site Recovery traffic is not routed to on-premises. [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md)
VNET to VNET connection    | Supported | [Learn more](./azure-to-azure-about-networking.md)
Virtual Network Service Endpoints | Supported | If you are restricting the virtual network access to storage accounts, ensure that the trusted Microsoft services are allowed access to the storage account.
Accelerated networking | Supported | Accelerated networking must be enabled on source VM. [Learn more](azure-vm-disaster-recovery-with-accelerated-networking.md).
Palo Alto Network Appliance | Not supported | With third-party appliances, there are often restrictions imposed by the provider inside the Virtual Machine. Azure Site Recovery needs agent, extensions, and outbound connectivity to be available. But the appliance does not let any outbound activity to be configured inside the Virtual Machine.
IPv6  | Not supported | Mixed configurations that include both IPv4 and IPv6 are also not supported. Free up the subnet of the IPv6 range before any Site Recovery operation.
Private link access to Site Recovery service | Supported | [Learn more](azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints.md)
Tags  | Supported | User-generated tags on NICs are replicated every 24 hours.
