# Install and run Form Recognizer v2.1-preview containers

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Form Recognizer containers are in gated preview. To use them, you must submit an [online request](https://aka.ms/csgate), and receive approval. For more information, *see* [**Request approval to run container**](#request-approval-to-run-the-container) below.
>
> * The online request form requires that you provide a valid email address that belongs to the organization that owns the Azure subscription ID and that you have or have been granted access to that subscription.

Azure Form Recognizer is an Azure Applied AI Service that lets you build automated data processing software using machine-learning technology. Form Recognizer enables you to identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, table data, and more from your form documents and output structured data that includes the relationships in the original file.

In this article you'll learn how to download, install, and run Form Recognizer containers. Containers enable you to run the Form Recognizer service in your own environment. Containers are great for specific security and data governance requirements. Form Recognizer features are supported by six Form Recognizer feature containersâ€”**Layout**, **Business Card**,**ID Document**,  **Receipt**, **Invoice**, and **Custom** (for Receipt, Business Card and ID Document containers you will also need the **Read** OCR container).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need an active [**Azure account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).  If you don't have one, you can [**create a free account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

You'll also need the following to use Form Recognizer containers:

| Required | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Familiarity with Docker** | You should have a basic understanding of Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker`  [terminology and commands](/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-terminology). |
| **Docker Engine installed** | <ul><li>You need the Docker Engine installed on a [host computer](#host-computer-requirements). Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms). For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).</li><li> Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure. </li><li> On **Windows**, Docker must also be configured to support **Linux** containers.</li></ul>  |
|**Form Recognizer resource** | A [**single-service Azure Form Recognizer**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) or [**multi-service Cognitive Services**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne) resource in the Azure portal. To use the containers, you must have the associated API key and endpoint URI. Both values are available on the Azure portal Form Recognizer **Keys and Endpoint** page: <ul><li>**{FORM_RECOGNIZER_API_KEY}**: one of the two available resource keys.<li>**{FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT_URI}**: the endpoint for the resource used to track billing information.</li></li></ul>|
| **Computer Vision API resource** | **To process business cards, ID documents, or Receipts, you'll need a Computer Vision resource.** <ul><li>You can access the Recognize Text feature as either an Azure resource (the REST API or SDK) or a **cognitive-services-recognize-text** [container](../../../cognitive-services/Computer-vision/computer-vision-how-to-install-containers.md#get-the-container-image-with-docker-pull). The usual [billing](#billing) fees apply.</li> <li>If you use the **cognitive-services-recognize-text** container, make sure that your Computer Vision key for the Form Recognizer container is the key specified in the Computer Vision `docker run`  or `docker compose` command for the **cognitive-services-recognize-text** container and  your billing endpoint is the container's endpoint (for example, `http://localhost:5000`). If you use both the Computer Vision container and Form Recognizer container together on the same host, they can't both be started with the default port of *5000*. </li></ul></br>Pass in both the API key and endpoints for your Computer Vision Azure cloud or Cognitive Services container:<ul><li>**{COMPUTER_VISION_API_KEY}**: one of the two available resource keys.</li><li> **{COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT_URI}**: the endpoint for the resource used to track billing information.</li></ul> |

|Optional|Purpose|
|---------|----------|
|**Azure CLI (command-line interface)** | The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) enables you to use a set of online commands to create and manage Azure resources. It is available to install in Windows, macOS, and Linux environments and can be run in a Docker container and Azure Cloud Shell. |
|||

## Request approval to run the container

Complete and submit the [Application for Gated Services form](https://aka.ms/csgate)  to request approval to run the container.

The form requests information about you, your company, and the user scenario for which you'll use the container. After you submit the form, the Azure Cognitive Services team will review it and email you with a decision within 10 business days.

On the form, you must use an email address associated with an Azure subscription ID. The Azure resource you use to run the container must have been created with the approved Azure subscription ID. Check your email (both inbox and junk folders) for updates on the status of your application from Microsoft. After you're approved, you will be able to run the container after downloading it from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), described later in the article.

## Host computer requirements

The host is a x64-based computer that runs the Docker container. It can be a computer on your premises or a Docker hosting service in Azure, such as:

* [Azure Kubernetes Service](../../../aks/index.yml).
* [Azure Container Instances](../../../container-instances/index.yml).
* A [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster deployed to [Azure Stack](/azure-stack/operator). For more information, see [Deploy Kubernetes to Azure Stack](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-solution-template-kubernetes-deploy).

### Container requirements and recommendations

#### Required containers

The following table lists the additional supporting container(s) for each Form Recognizer container you download. Refer to the [Billing](#billing) section for more information.

| Feature container | Supporting container(s) |
|---------|-----------|
| **Layout** | None |
| **Business Card** | **Computer Vision Read**|
| **ID Document** | **Computer Vision Read** |
| **Invoice**   | **Layout** |
| **Receipt** |**Computer Vision Read** |
| **Custom** | **Custom API**, **Custom Supervised**, **Layout**|

#### Recommended CPU cores and memory

> [!Note]
> The minimum and recommended values are based on Docker limits and *not* the host machine resources.

##### Read, Layout, and Prebuilt containers

| Container | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Read 3.2 | 8 cores, 16-GB memory | 8 cores, 24-GB memory|
| Layout 2.1-preview | 8 cores, 16-GB memory | 8 cores, 24-GB memory |
| Business Card 2.1-preview | 2 cores, 4-GB memory | 4 cores, 4-GB memory |
| ID Document 2.1-preview | 1 core, 2-GB memory |2 cores, 2-GB memory |
| Invoice 2.1-preview | 4 cores, 8-GB memory | 8 cores, 8-GB memory |
| Receipt 2.1-preview |  4 cores, 8-GB memory | 8 cores, 8-GB memory  |

##### Custom containers

The following host machine requirements are applicable to **train and analyze** requests:

| Container | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Custom API| 0.5 cores, 0.5-GB memory| 1 cores, 1-GB memory |
|Custom Supervised | 4 cores, 2-GB memory | 8 cores, 4-GB memory|

If you are only making analyze calls, the host machine requirements are as follows:

| Container | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
|Custom Supervised (Analyze) | 1 core, 0.5-GB | 2 cores, 1-GB memory |

* Each core must be at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.
* Core and memory correspond to the `--cpus` and `--memory` settings, which are used as part of the `docker compose` or `docker run`  command.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command to list your downloaded container images. For example, the following command lists the ID, repository, and tag of each downloaded container image, formatted as a table:
>
>  ```docker
>  docker images --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}"
>
>  IMAGE ID         REPOSITORY                TAG
>  <image-id>       <repository-path/name>    <tag-name>
>  ```

## Run the container with the **docker-compose up** command

* Replace the {ENDPOINT_URI} and {API_KEY} values with your resource Endpoint URI and the API Key from the Azure resource page.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Azure portal keys and endpoint page.":::

* Ensure that the EULA value is set to "accept".

* The `EULA`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey`  values must be specified; otherwise the container won't start.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The subscription keys are used to access your Form Recognizer resource. Do not share your keys. Store them securely, for example, using Azure Key Vault. We also recommend regenerating these keys regularly. Only one key is necessary to make an API call. When regenerating the first key, you can use the second key for continued access to the service.

        }
    }
}
```

* Gather a set of at least six forms of the same type. You'll use this data to train the model and test a form. You can use a [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) (download and extract *sample_data.zip*). Download the training files to the **shared** folder you created above.

* If you want to label your data, download the [Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/OCR-Form-Tools/releases/tag/v2.1-ga). The download will import the labeling tool .exe file that you'll use to label the data present on your local file system. You can ignore any warnings that occur during the download process.

#### Create a new Sample Labeling tool project

* Open the labeling tool by double-clicking on the Sample Labeling tool .exe file.
* On the left pane of the tool, select the connections tab.
* Select to create a new project and give it a name and description.
* For the provider, choose the local file system option. For the local folder, make sure you enter the path to the folder where you stored the sample data files.
* Navigate back to the home tab and select the "Use custom to train a model with labels and key value pairs option".
* Select the train button on the left pane to train the labeled model.
* Save this connection and use it to label your requests.
* You can choose to analyze the file of your choice against the trained model.

#### &bullet; Create a **docker compose** file

1. Name this file **docker-compose.yml**

2. Below is a self-contained `docker compose` example to run Form Recognizer Layout, Label Tool, Custom API, and Custom Supervised containers together.

## Validate that the service is running

There are several ways to validate that the container is running:

* The container provides a homepage at `\` as a visual validation that the container is running.

* You can open your favorite web browser and navigate to the external IP address and exposed port of the container in question. Use the various request URLs below to validate the container is running. The example request URLs listed below are `http://localhost:5000`, but your specific container may vary. Keep in mind that you're  navigating to your container's **External IP address** and exposed port.

  Request URL    | Purpose
  ----------- | --------
  |**http://<span></span>localhost:5000/** | The container provides a home page.
  |**http://<span></span>localhost:5000/ready**     | Requested with GET, this request provides a verification that the container is ready to accept a query against the model. This request can be used for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.
  |**http://<span></span>localhost:5000/status** | Requested with GET, this request verifies if the api-key used to start the container is valid without causing an endpoint query. This request can be used for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.
  |**http://<span></span>localhost:5000/swagger** | The container provides a full set of documentation for the endpoints and a Try it out feature. With this feature, you can enter your settings into a web-based HTML form and make the query without having to write any code. After the query returns, an example CURL command is provided to demonstrate the HTTP headers and body format that's required.

## Stop the containers

To stop the containers, use the following command:

```console
docker-compose down
```

## Billing

The Form Recognizer containers send billing information to Azure by using a Form Recognizer resource on your Azure account.

Queries to the container are billed at the pricing tier of the Azure resource that's used for the `ApiKey`. You will be billed for each container instance used to process your documents and images. Thus, If you use the business card feature, you will be billed for the Form Recognizer `BusinessCard` and `Computer Vision Read` container instances. For the invoice feature, you will be billed for the Form Recognizer `Invoice` and `Layout` container instances. *See*, [Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/) and Computer Vision [Read feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) container pricing.

Azure Cognitive Services containers aren't licensed to run without being connected to the metering / billing endpoint. Containers must be enabled to communicate billing information with the billing endpoint at all times. Cognitive Services containers don't send customer data, such as the image or text that's being analyzed, to Microsoft.

### Connect to Azure

The container needs the billing argument values to run. These values allow the container to connect to the billing endpoint. The container reports usage about every 10 to 15 minutes. If the container doesn't connect to Azure within the allowed time window, the container continues to run but doesn't serve queries until the billing endpoint is restored. The connection is attempted 10 times at the same time interval of 10 to 15 minutes. If it can't connect to the billing endpoint within the 10 tries, the container stops serving requests. See the [Cognitive Services container FAQ](../../../cognitive-services/containers/container-faq.yml#how-does-billing-work) for an example of the information sent to Microsoft for billing.

### Billing arguments

The [**docker-compose up**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/) command will start the container when all three of the following options are provided with valid values:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ApiKey` | The API key of the Cognitive Services resource that's used to track billing information.<br/>The value of this option must be set to an API key for the provisioned resource that's specified in `Billing`. |
| `Billing` | The endpoint of the Cognitive Services resource that's used to track billing information.<br/>The value of this option must be set to the endpoint URI of a provisioned Azure resource.|
| `Eula` | Indicates that you accepted the license for the container.<br/>The value of this option must be set to **accept**. |

For more information about these options, see [Configure containers](form-recognizer-container-configuration.md).

## Summary

That's it! In this article, you learned concepts and workflows for downloading, installing, and running Form Recognizer containers. In summary:

* Form Recognizer provides seven Linux containers for Docker.
* Container images are downloaded from mcr.
* Container images run in Docker.
* The billing information must be specified when you instantiate a container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data (for example, the image or text that is being analyzed) to Microsoft.
