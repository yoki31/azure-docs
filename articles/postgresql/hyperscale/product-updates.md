## Features in preview

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) offers
previews for unreleased features. Preview versions are provided
without a service level agreement, and aren't recommended for
production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or
might have constrained capabilities.  For more information, see

Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)

Here are the features currently available for preview:
