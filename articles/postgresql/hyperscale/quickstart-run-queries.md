# Run queries

## Prerequisites

To follow this quickstart, you'll first need to:

1. [Create a server group](quickstart-create-portal.md) in the Azure portal.
2. [Connect to the server group](quickstart-connect-psql.md) with psql to
   run SQL commands.
3. [Create and distribute tables](quickstart-distribute-tables.md) with our
   example dataset.

## Aggregate queries

Now it's time for the fun part in our quickstart series: actually running some
queries. Let's start with a simple `count (*)` to see how much data we loaded:

```sql
SELECT count(*) from github_events;
```

That worked nicely. We'll come back to that sort of aggregation in a bit, but for now letâ€™s look at a few other queries. Within the JSONB `payload` column there's a good bit of data, but it varies based on event type. `PushEvent` events contain a size that includes the number of distinct commits for the push. We can use it to find the total number of commits per hour:

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('hour', created_at) AS hour,
       sum((payload->>'distinct_size')::int) AS num_commits
FROM github_events
WHERE event_type = 'PushEvent'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

So far the queries have involved the github\_events exclusively, but we can combine this information with github\_users. Since we sharded both users and events on the same identifier (`user_id`), the rows of both tables with matching user IDs will be [colocated](concepts-colocation.md) on the same database nodes and can easily be joined.

If we join on `user_id`, Hyperscale (Citus) can push the join execution down into shards for execution in parallel on worker nodes. For example, let's find the users who created the greatest number of repositories:

```sql
SELECT gu.login, count(*)
  FROM github_events ge
  JOIN github_users gu
    ON ge.user_id = gu.user_id
 WHERE ge.event_type = 'CreateEvent'
   AND ge.payload @> '{"ref_type": "repository"}'
 GROUP BY gu.login
 ORDER BY count(*) DESC;
```

## Next steps

- Follow a tutorial to [build scalable multi-tenant
  applications](./tutorial-design-database-multi-tenant.md)
- Determine the best [initial
  size](howto-scale-initial.md) for your server group
