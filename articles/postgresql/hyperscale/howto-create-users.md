# Create users in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)

## The server admin account

The PostgreSQL engine uses
[roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html) to control
access to database objects, and a newly created Hyperscale (Citus) server group
comes with several roles pre-defined:

* The [default PostgreSQL roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html)
* `azure_pg_admin`
* `postgres`
* `citus`

Since Hyperscale (Citus) is a managed PaaS service, only Microsoft can sign in with the
`postgres` superuser role. For limited administrative access, Hyperscale (Citus)
provides the `citus` role.

Permissions for the `citus` role:

* Read all configuration variables, even variables normally visible only to
  superusers.
* Read all pg\_stat\_\* views and use various statistics-related
  extensions--even views or extensions normally visible only to superusers.
* Execute monitoring functions that may take ACCESS SHARE locks on tables,
  potentially for a long time.
* [Create PostgreSQL extensions](concepts-extensions.md) (because
  the role is a member of `azure_pg_admin`).

Notably, the `citus` role has some restrictions:

* Can't create roles
* Can't create databases

## How to create additional user roles

As mentioned, the `citus` admin account lacks permission to create additional
users. To add a user, use the Azure portal interface.

1. Go to the **Roles** page for your Hyperscale (Citus) server group, and
   select **+ Add**:

2. Enter the role name and password. Select **Save**.

The user will be created on the coordinator node of the server group,
and propagated to all the worker nodes. Roles created through the Azure
portal have the `LOGIN` attribute, which means theyâ€™re true users who
can sign in to the database.

## How to modify privileges for user role

New user roles are commonly used to provide database access with restricted
privileges. To modify user privileges, use standard PostgreSQL commands, using
a tool such as PgAdmin or psql. (See [Connect to a Hyperscale (Citus) server
group](quickstart-connect-psql.md).)

For example, to allow `db_user` to read `mytable`, grant the permission:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO db_user;
```

Hyperscale (Citus) propagates single-table GRANT statements through the entire
cluster, applying them on all worker nodes. It also propagates GRANTs that are
system-wide (for example, for all tables in a schema):

```sql
-- applies to the coordinator node and propagates to workers
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO db_user;
```

## How to delete a user role or change their password

To update a user, visit the **Roles** page for your Hyperscale (Citus) server group,
and select the ellipses **...** next to the user. The ellipses will open a menu
to delete the user or reset their password.

The `citus` role is privileged and can't be deleted.

## Next steps

Open the firewall for the IP addresses of the new users' machines to enable
them to connect: [Create and manage Hyperscale (Citus) firewall rules using
the Azure portal](howto-manage-firewall-using-portal.md).
