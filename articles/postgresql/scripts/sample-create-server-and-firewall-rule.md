# Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and configure a firewall rule using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and configures a server-level firewall rule. Once the script has been successfully run, the PostgreSQL server can be accessed from all Azure services and the configured IP address.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](../../../includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/postgresql/create-postgresql-server-and-firewall-rule/create-postgresql-server-and-firewall-rule.sh" range="4-36":::

## Clean up deployment

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az postgres server create](/cli/azure/postgres/server) | Creates a PostgreSQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az postgres server firewall create](/cli/azure/postgres/server/firewall-rule) | Creates a firewall rule to allow access to the server and databases under it from the entered IP address range. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
