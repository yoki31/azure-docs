# Make indexer connections to Azure Storage as a trusted service

Indexers in an Azure Cognitive Search service that access data in Azure Storage accounts can make use of the [trusted service exception](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#exceptions) capability to securely access data. This mechanism offers customers who are unable to grant [indexer access using IP firewall rules](search-indexer-howto-access-ip-restricted.md) a simple, secure, and free alternative for accessing data in storage accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for accessing data in storage accounts through a trusted service exception is limited to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage. Azure Table Storage is not supported.

## Step 1: Configure a connection using a managed identity

Follow the instructions in [Set up a connection to an Azure Storage account using a managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-storage.md). When you are finished, you will have registered your search service with Azure Active Directory as a trusted service, and you will have granted permissions in Azure Storage that gives the search identity specific rights to access data or information.

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions guide you through a portal approach for configuring Cognitive Search as a trusted service. To accomplish this in code, you can use the [REST API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/2021-04-01-preview/services/create-or-update), [Azure PowerShell](search-manage-powershell.md#create-a-service-with-a-system-assigned-managed-identity), or [Azure CLI](search-manage-azure-cli.md#create-a-service-with-a-system-assigned-managed-identity).

## Step 2: Allow trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account

In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Firewalls and Virtual Networks** tab of the storage account. Ensure that the option **Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account** is checked. This option will only permit the specific search service instance with appropriate role-based access to the storage account (strong authentication) to access data in the storage account, even if it's secured by IP firewall rules.

Indexers will now be able to access data in the storage account, even if the account is secured via IP firewall rules.
