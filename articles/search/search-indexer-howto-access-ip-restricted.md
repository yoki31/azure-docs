# Configure IP firewall rules to allow indexer connections from Azure Cognitive Search

On behalf of an indexer, a search service will issue outbound calls to an external Azure resource to pull in data during indexing. If your Azure resource uses IP firewall rules to filter incoming calls, you'll need to create an inbound rule in your firewall that admits indexer requests.

This article explains how to find the IP address of your search service and configure an inbound IP rule on an Azure Storage account. While specific to Azure Storage, this approach also works for other Azure resources that use IP firewall rules for data access, such as Cosmos DB and Azure SQL.

> [!NOTE]
> IP firewall rules for a storage account are only effective if the storage account and the search service are in different regions. If your setup does not permit this, we recommend utilizing the [trusted service exception option](search-indexer-howto-access-trusted-service-exception.md) as an alternative.

## Get a search service IP address

1. Determine the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your search service. This will look like `<search-service-name>.search.windows.net`. You can find the FQDN by looking up your search service on the Azure portal.

1. Look up the IP address of the search service by performing a `nslookup` (or a `ping`) of the FQDN on a command prompt. Make sure you remove the "https://" prefix from the FQDN.

1. Copy the IP address so that you can specify it on an inbound rule in the next step. In the example below, the IP address that you should copy is "150.0.0.1".

   ```azurepowershell
   nslookup contoso.search.windows.net
   Server:  server.example.org
   Address:  10.50.10.50
    
   Non-authoritative answer:
   Name:    <name>
   Address:  150.0.0.1
   aliases:  contoso.search.windows.net
   ```

## Get IP addresses for "AzureCognitiveSearch" service tag

If your search service workloads include skillset execution, create an inbound rule that allows requests from the [multi-tenant execution environment](search-indexer-securing-resources.md#indexer-execution-environment). This step explains how to get the range of IP addresses needed for this inbound rule.

An IP address range is defined for each region that supports Azure Cognitive Search. You can get this IP address range from the `AzureCognitiveSearch` service tag.

1. Get the IP address ranges for the `AzureCognitiveSearch` service tag using either the [discovery API](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#use-the-service-tag-discovery-api) or the [downloadable JSON file](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#discover-service-tags-by-using-downloadable-json-files).

1. If the search service is the Azure Public cloud, download the [Azure Public JSON file](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519).

1. Open the JSON file and search for "AzureCognitiveSearch". For a search service in WestUS2, the IP addresses for the multi-tenant indexer execution environment are:

    ```json
    {
    "name": "AzureCognitiveSearch.WestUS2",
    "id": "AzureCognitiveSearch.WestUS2",
    "properties": {
       "changeNumber": 1,
       "region": "westus2",
       "regionId": 38,
       "platform": "Azure",
       "systemService": "AzureCognitiveSearch",
       "addressPrefixes": [
          "20.42.129.192/26",
          "40.91.93.84/32",
          "40.91.127.116/32",
          "40.91.127.241/32",
          "51.143.104.54/32",
          "51.143.104.90/32",
          "2603:1030:c06:1::180/121"
       ],
       "networkFeatures": null
    }
    },
    ```

1. For IP addresses have the "/32" suffix, drop the "/32" (40.91.93.84/32 becomes 40.91.93.84 in the rule definition). All other IP addresses can be used verbatim.

## Add IP addresses to IP firewall rules

Now that you have the necessary IP addresses, you can set up the inbound rule. The easiest way to add IP address ranges to a storage account's firewall rule is through the Azure portal. 

1. Locate the storage account on the portal and open **Networking** on the left navigation pane.

1. In the **Firewall and virtual networks** tab, choose **Selected networks**.

   :::image type="content" source="media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\storage-firewall.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Storage Firewall and virtual networks page" border="true":::

1. Add the IP addresses obtained previously (one for the search service IP, plus all of the IP ranges for the "AzureCognitiveSearch" service tag) in the address range and select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media\search-indexer-howto-secure-access\storage-firewall-ip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the IP address section of the page." border="true":::

It can take five to ten minutes for the firewall rules to be updated, after which indexers should be able to access the data in the storage account.
