# Set up a connection to an Azure Storage account using a managed identity

This page describes how to set up an indexer connection to an Azure storage account using a managed identity instead of providing credentials in the data source object connection string.

You can use a system-assigned managed identity or a user-assigned managed identity (preview).

This article assumes familiarity with indexer concepts and configuration. If you're new to indexers, start with these links:

* [Indexer overview](search-indexer-overview.md)
* [Azure Blob indexer](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md)
* [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 indexer](search-howto-index-azure-data-lake-storage.md)
* [Azure Table indexer](search-howto-indexing-azure-tables.md)

## 1 - Set up a managed identity

Set up the [managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) for an Azure Cognitive Search service using one of the following options. 

The search service must be Basic tier or above.

### Option 1 - Turn on system-assigned managed identity

When a system-assigned managed identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for your search service that can be used to authenticate to other Azure services within the same tenant and subscription. You can then use this identity in Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) assignments that allow access to data during indexing.

After selecting **Save** you will see an Object ID that has been assigned to your search service.

![Object ID](./media/search-managed-identities/system-assigned-identity-object-id.png "Object ID")

### Option 2 - Assign a user-assigned managed identity to the search service (preview)

If you don't already have a user-assigned managed identity created, you'll need to create one. A user-assigned managed identity is a resource on Azure.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **+ Create a resource**.

1. In the "Search services and marketplace" search bar, search for "User Assigned Managed Identity" and then select **Create**.

1. Give the identity a descriptive name.

Next, assign the user-assigned managed identity to the search service. This can be done using the [2021-04-01-preview management API](/rest/api/searchmanagement/2021-04-01-preview/services/create-or-update).

The identity property takes a type and one or more fully-qualified user-assigned identities:

* **type** is the type of identity. Valid values are "SystemAssigned", "UserAssigned", or "SystemAssigned, UserAssigned" for both. A value of "None" will clear any previously assigned identities from the search service.

* **userAssignedIdentities** includes the details of the user assigned managed identity. The format is:

  ```bash
    /subscriptions/<your-subscription-ID>/resourcegroups/<your-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<your-managed-identity-name>
  ```

Example of a user-assigned managed identity assignment:

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/[search service name]?api-version=2021-04-01-preview
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "location": "[region]",
  "sku": {
    "name": "[sku]"
  },
  "properties": {
    "replicaCount": [replica count],
    "partitionCount": [partition count],
    "hostingMode": "default"
  },
  "identity": {
    "type": "UserAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
      "/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourcegroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/[name of managed identity]": {}
    }
  }
} 
```

## 2 - Add a role assignment

In this step, you will either give your Azure Cognitive Search service or user-assigned managed identity permission to read data from your storage account.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Storage account that contains the data that you would like to index.

2. Select **Access control (IAM)**

3. Select **Add** then **Add role assignment**

    ![Add role assignment](./media/search-managed-identities/add-role-assignment-storage.png "Add role assignment")

4. Select the appropriate role(s) based on the storage account type that you would like to index:

    * Azure Blob Storage requires that you add your search service to the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role.
    * Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 requires that you add your search service to the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role.
    * Azure Table Storage requires that you add your search service to the **Reader and Data Access** role.

5. Leave **Assign access to** as **Azure AD user, group or service principal**

6. If you're using a system-assigned managed identity, search for your search service, then select it. If you're using a user-assigned managed identity, search for the name of the user-assigned managed identity, then select it. Select **Save**.

    Example for Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using a system-assigned managed identity:

    ![Add Storage Blob Data Reader role assignment](./media/search-managed-identities/add-role-assignment-storage-blob-data-reader.png "Add Storage Blob Data Reader role assignment")

    Example for Azure Table Storage using a system-assigned managed identity:

    ![Add reader and data access role assignment](./media/search-managed-identities/add-role-assignment-reader-and-data-access.png "Add reader and data access role assignment")

For a code examples in C#, see [Index Data Lake Gen2 using Azure AD](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/blob/master/data-lake-gen2-acl-indexing/README.md) on GitHub.

## 3 - Create the data source

Create the data source and provide either a system-assigned managed identity or a user-assigned managed identity (preview). Note that you are no longer using the Management REST API in the below steps.

### Option 1 - Create the data source with a system-assigned managed identity

The [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source), Azure portal, and the [.NET SDK](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.searchindexerdatasourceconnection) support using a system-assigned managed identity. Below is an example of how to create a data source to index data from a storage account using the [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source) and a managed identity connection string. The managed identity connection string format is the same for the REST API, .NET SDK, and the Azure portal.

When indexing from a storage account, the data source must have the following required properties:

* **name** is the unique name of the data source within your search service.
* **type**
    * Azure Blob storage: `azureblob`
    * Azure Table storage: `azuretable`
    * Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: `adlsgen2`
* **credentials**
    * When using a managed identity to authenticate, the **credentials** format is different than when not using a managed identity. Here you will provide a ResourceId that has no account key or password. The ResourceId must include the subscription ID of the storage account, the resource group of the storage account, and the storage account name.
    * Managed identity format: 
        * *ResourceId=/subscriptions/**your subscription ID**/resourceGroups/**your resource group name**/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/**your storage account name**/;*
* **container** specifies a container or table name in your storage account. By default, all blobs within the container are retrievable. If you only want to index blobs in a particular virtual directory, you can specify that directory using the optional **query** parameter.

Example of how to create a blob data source object using the [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source):

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=2020-06-30
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]

{
    "name" : "blob-datasource",
    "type" : "azureblob",
    "credentials" : { 
        "connectionString" : "ResourceId=/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/[storage account name]/;" 
    },
    "container" : { 
        "name" : "my-container", "query" : "<optional-virtual-directory-name>" 
    }
}   
```

### Option 2 - Create the data source with a user-assigned managed identity

The 2021-04-30-preview REST API support the user-assigned managed identity. Below is an example of how to create a data source to index data from a storage account using the [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source), a managed identity connection string, and the user-assigned managed identity.

When indexing from a storage account, the data source must have the following required properties:

* **name** is the unique name of the data source within your search service.
* **type**
    * Azure Blob storage: `azureblob`
    * Azure Table storage: `azuretable`
    * Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: `adlsgen2`
* **credentials**
    * When using a managed identity to authenticate, the **credentials** format is different than when not using a managed identity. Here you will provide a ResourceId that has no account key or password. The ResourceId must include the subscription ID of the storage account, the resource group of the storage account, and the storage account name.
    * Managed identity format: 
        * *ResourceId=/subscriptions/**your subscription ID**/resourceGroups/**your resource group name**/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/**your storage account name**/;*
* **container** specifies a container or table name in your storage account. By default, all blobs within the container are retrievable. If you only want to index blobs in a particular virtual directory, you can specify that directory using the optional **query** parameter.
* **identity** contains the collection of user-assigned managed identities. Only one user-assigned managed identity should be provided when creating the data source.
    * **userAssignedIdentities** includes the details of the user assigned managed identity.
        * User-assigned managed identity format: 
            * /subscriptions/**subscription ID**/resourcegroups/**resource group name**/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/**name of managed identity**

Example of how to create a blob data source object using the [REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/create-data-source):

```http
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=2021-04-30-preview
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]

{
    "name" : "blob-datasource",
    "type" : "azureblob",
    "credentials" : { 
        "connectionString" : "ResourceId=/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/[storage account name]/;" 
    },
    "container" : { 
        "name" : "my-container", "query" : "<optional-virtual-directory-name>" 
    },
    "identity" : { 
        "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.DataUserAssignedIdentity",
        "userAssignedIdentity" : "/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourcegroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/[managed identity name]" 
    }
}   
```

## 4 - Create the index

The index specifies the fields in a document, attributes, and other constructs that shape the search experience.

Here's how to create an index with a searchable `content` field to store the text extracted from blobs:   

```http
    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes?api-version=2020-06-30
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: [admin key]

    {
          "name" : "my-target-index",
          "fields": [
            { "name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "searchable": false },
            { "name": "content", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false }
          ]
    }
```

For more on creating indexes, see [Create Index](/rest/api/searchservice/create-index)

## 5 - Create the indexer

An indexer connects a data source with a target search index, and provides a schedule to automate the data refresh.

Once the index and data source have been created, you're ready to create the indexer.

Example indexer definition for a blob indexer:

```http
    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers?api-version=2020-06-30
    Content-Type: application/json
    api-key: [admin key]

    {
      "name" : "blob-indexer",
      "dataSourceName" : "blob-datasource",
      "targetIndexName" : "my-target-index",
      "schedule" : { "interval" : "PT2H" }
    }
```

This indexer will run every two hours (schedule interval is set to "PT2H"). To run an indexer every 30 minutes, set the interval to "PT30M". The shortest supported interval is 5 minutes. The schedule is optional - if omitted, an indexer runs only once when it's created. However, you can run an indexer on-demand at any time.   

For more details on the Create Indexer API, check out [Create Indexer](/rest/api/searchservice/create-indexer).

For more information about defining indexer schedules see [How to schedule indexers for Azure Cognitive Search](search-howto-schedule-indexers.md).

## Accessing network secured data in storage accounts

Azure storage accounts can be further secured using firewalls and virtual networks. If you want to index content from a blob storage account or Data Lake Gen2 storage account that is secured using a firewall or virtual network, follow the instructions for [Accessing data in storage accounts securely via trusted service exception](search-indexer-howto-access-trusted-service-exception.md).
