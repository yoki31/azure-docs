# Renew an expired subscription, purchase a new on, or transfer your Azure resources

If your Visual Studio subscription expires or is removed, all the subscription benefits, including the monthly Azure dev/test individual credit are no longer available. To continue using Azure with a monthly credit, you will need to renew your subscription, purchase a new subscription, and/or transfer your Azure resources to a different Azure subscription that includes the Azure dev/test individual credit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must transfer your resources to another Azure subscription before your current Azure subscription is disabled or you will lose access to your data.
>
> If you donâ€™t take one of these actions, your Azure subscription will be disabled at the time specified in your email notification. If the subscription is disabled, you can reenable it as a pay-as-you-go subscription by following [these steps](../../cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer.md).

## Maintain a subscription to use monthly credits
 
There are several ways to continue using a monthly credit for Azure. To save your Azure resources, you must [transfer your resources](../../azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription.md) to another Azure subscription, regardless of which of the following action you choose:

- **If you purchase your Visual Studio subscription directly**, purchase a new subscription or renew your subscription through Microsoft Store.

- [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

- [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

- [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

- **If someone in your organization purchases subscriptions for your organization**, [contact your Visual Studio subscription admin](/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) and request a subscription that provides the monthly credit that you need.

- **If you have another active Visual Studio subscription** at the same subscription level, you can use it to set up a new Azure credit subscription.

## Convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go

If you no longer need a Visual Studio subscription or credit but you want to continue using your Azure resources, convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go pricing by [removing your spending limit](../../cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit.md#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal).
