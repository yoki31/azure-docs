# Import SAP OData metadata as an API

This article shows how to import an OData service using its metadata description. In this article, [SAP Gateway](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_GATEWAY) serves as an example. However, you can apply the approach to any OData-compliant service.

In this article, you'll: 
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Convert OData metadata to an OpenAPI specification
> * Import the OpenAPI specification to API Management
> * Complete API configuration
> * Test the API in the Azure portal

## Prerequisites

- An existing API Management instance. [Create one if you haven't already](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
- An SAP system and service exposed as OData v2 or v4. 
- If your SAP backend uses a self-signed certificate (for test purposes), you may need to disable the verification of the trust chain for SSL. To do so, configure a [backend](backends.md) in your API Management instance:
    1. In the Azure portal, under **APIs**, select **Backends** > **+ Add**.
    1.  Add a **Custom URL** pointing to the SAP backend service.
    1.  Uncheck **Validate certificate chain** and **Validate certificate name**. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > For production scenarios, use proper certificates for end-to-end SSL verification.

## Convert OData metadata to OpenAPI JSON

1. Retrieve metadata XML from your SAP service. Use one of these methods: 

   * Use the SAP Gateway Client (transaction `/IWFND/GW_CLIENT`), or 
   * Make a direct HTTP call to retrieve the XML:
   `http://<OData server URL>:<port>/<path>/$metadata`.

1. Convert the OData XML to OpenAPI JSON format. Use an OASIS open-source tool for [OData v2](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-openapi/tree/main/tools) or [OData v4](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-openapi/tree/main/lib), depending on your metadata XML. 

   The following is an example command to convert OData v2 XML for the test service `epm_ref_apps_prod_man_srv`:

   ```console
   odata-openapi -p --basePath '/sap/opu/odata/sap/epm_ref_apps_prod_man_srv' \
    --scheme https --host <your IP address>:<your SSL port> \
    ./epm_ref_apps_prod_man_srv.xml
   ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > * For test purposes with a single XML file, you can use a [web-based converter](https://aka.ms/ODataOpenAPI) based on the open-source tool.
    > * With the tool or the web-based converter, specifying the \<IP address>:\<port> of your SAP OData server is optional. Alternatively, add this information later in your generated OpenAPI specification or after importing to API Management.

1. Save the `openapi-spec.json` file locally for import to API Management.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-navigate-to-instance](../../includes/api-management-navigate-to-instance.md)]

## Import and publish backend API 

1. From the side navigation menu, under the **APIs** section, select **APIs**.
1. Under **Create a new definition**, select **OpenAPI specification**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/import-api-from-oas/oas-api.png" alt-text="OpenAPI specifiction":::

1. Click **Select a file**, and select the `openapi-spec.json` file that you saved locally in a previous step.

1. Enter API settings. You can set the values during creation or configure them later by going to the **Settings** tab. 
    * In **API URL suffix**, we recommend using the same URL path as in the original SAP service.

    * For more information about API settings, see [Import and publish your first API](import-and-publish.md#import-and-publish-a-backend-api) tutorial.

1. Select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> The API import limitations are documented in [another article](api-management-api-import-restrictions.md).


## Complete API configuration

[Add](add-api-manually.md#add-and-test-an-operation) the following three operations to the API that you imported.

- `GET /$metadata`

    |Operation  |Description  |Further configuration for operation  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |`GET /$metadata`     |   Enables API Management to reach the `$metadata` endpoint, which is required for client integration with the OData server.<br/><br/>This required operation isn't included in the OpenAPI specification that you generated and imported.    |  Add a `200 OK` response.       |

    :::image type="content" source="media/sap-api/get-metadata-operation.png" alt-text="Get metadata operation":::

- `HEAD /` 

    |Operation  |Description  |Further configuration for operation  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |`HEAD /`     | Enables the client to exchange Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens with the SAP server, when required.<br/><br/>SAP also allows CSRF token exchange using the GET verb.<br/><br/> CSRF token exchange isnâ€™t covered in this article. See an example API Management [policy snippet](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets/blob/master/examples/Get%20X-CSRF%20token%20from%20SAP%20gateway%20using%20send%20request.policy.xml)     to broker token exchange.     |     N/A    |

    :::image type="content" source="media/sap-api/head-root-operation.png" alt-text="Operation to fetch tokens":::

- `GET /`

    Operation  |Description  |Further configuration for operation  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |`GET /`     |   Enables policy configuration at service root.   |    Configure the following inbound [rewrite-uri](api-management-transformation-policies.md#RewriteURL) policy to append a trailing slash to requests that are forwarded to service root:<br/><br>    `<rewrite-uri template="/" copy-unmatched-params="true" />` <br/><br/>This policy removes potential ambiguity of requests with or without trailing slashes, which are treated differently by some backends.|

    :::image type="content" source="media/sap-api/get-root-operation.png" alt-text="Get operation for service root":::

Also, configure authentication to your backend using an appropriate method for your environment. For examples, see [API Management authentication policies](api-management-authentication-policies.md).

## Test your API

1. Navigate to your API Management instance.
1. From the side navigation menu, under the **APIs** section, select **APIs**.
1. Under **All APIs**, select your imported API.
1. Select the **Test** tab to access the test console. 
1. Select an operation, enter any required values, and select **Send**. 

    For example, test the `GET /$metadata` call to verify connectivity to the SAP backend
1. View the response. To troubleshoot, [trace](api-management-howto-api-inspector.md) the call.
1. When testing is complete, exit the test console.

## Production considerations

* See an [example end-to-end scenario](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/08/12/.net-speaks-odata-too-how-to-implement-azure-app-service-with-sap-odata-gateway/) to integrate API Management with an SAP gateway.
* Control access to an SAP backend using API Management policies. See policy snippets for [SAP principal propagation](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets/blob/master/examples/Request%20OAuth2%20access%20token%20from%20SAP%20using%20AAD%20JWT%20token.xml) and [fetching an X-CSRF token](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets/blob/master/examples/Get%20X-CSRF%20token%20from%20SAP%20gateway%20using%20send%20request.policy.xml).
