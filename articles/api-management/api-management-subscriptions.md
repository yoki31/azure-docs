# Subscriptions in Azure API Management

In Azure API Management, *subscriptions* are the most common way for API consumers to access APIs published through an API Management instance. This article provides an overview of the concept.

## What are subscriptions?

By publishing APIs through API Management, you can easily secure API access using subscription keys. Developers who need to consume the published APIs must include a valid subscription key in HTTP requests when calling those APIs. Without a valid subscription key, the calls are:
* Rejected immediately by the API Management gateway. 
* Not forwarded to the back-end services.

To access APIs, you'll need a subscription and a subscription key. A *subscription* is a named container for a pair of subscription keys. 

> [!NOTE]
> Regularly regenerating keys is a common security precaution. Like most Azure services requiring a subscription key, API Management  generates keys in pairs. Each application using the service can switch from *key A* to *key B* and regenerate key A with minimal disruption, and vice versa. 

In addition,

* Developers can get subscriptions without approval from API publishers. 
* API publishers can create subscriptions directly for API consumers.

> [!TIP]
> API Management also supports other mechanisms for securing access to APIs, including the following examples:
> - [OAuth2.0](api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad.md)
> - [Client certificates](api-management-howto-mutual-certificates-for-clients.md)
> - [Restrict caller IPs](./api-management-access-restriction-policies.md#RestrictCallerIPs)

## Scope of subscriptions

Subscriptions can be associated with various scopes: [product](api-management-howto-add-products.md), all APIs, or an individual API.

### Subscriptions for a product

Traditionally, subscriptions in API Management were associated with a single [product](api-management-terminology.md) scope. Developers:
* Found the list of products on the developer portal. 
* Submitted subscription requests for the products they wanted to use. 
* Use the keys in those subscriptions (approved either automatically or by API publishers) to access all APIs in the product. 

Currently, the developer portal only shows the product scope subscriptions under the **User Profile** section.

### Subscriptions for all APIs or an individual API

You can also create keys that grant access to either:
* A single API, or 
* All APIs within an API Management instance. 

In these cases, you don't need to create a product and add APIs to it first. 

### All-access subscription

Each API Management instance comes with an immutable, all-APIs subscription (also called an *all-access* subscription). This built-in subscription makes it straightforward to test and debug APIs within the test console.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using an API-scoped subscription or the all-access subscription, any [policies](api-management-howto-policies.md) configured at the product scope aren't applied to requests from that subscription.

### Standalone subscriptions

API Management also allows *standalone* subscriptions, which are not associated with a developer account. This feature proves useful in scenarios similar to several developers or teams sharing a subscription.

Creating a subscription without assigning an owner makes it a standalone subscription. To grant developers and the rest of your team access to the standalone subscription key, either:
* Manually share the subscription key.
* Use a custom system to make the subscription key available to your team.

## Create subscriptions in Azure portal

API publishers can [create subscriptions](api-management-howto-create-subscriptions.md) directly in the Azure portal:

## How API Management handles requests with or without subscription keys

By default, a developer can only access a product or API by using a subscription key. Under certain scenarios, API publishers might want to publish a product or a particular API to the public without the requirement of subscriptions. While a publisher could choose to enable unsecured access to certain APIs, configuring another mechanism to secure client access is recommended.

To disable the subscription requirement using the portal:

* **Product** - Disable **Requires subscription** on the **Settings** page of the product.  
* **API** - Disable **Subscription required** on the **Settings** page of the API. 

After disabling the subscription requirement, the selected API or APIs can be accessed without a subscription key.

When API Management receives an API request from a client without a subscription key, it handles the request according to these rules: 

1. Check first for the existence of a product that includes the API but doesn't require a subscription (an *open* product). If the open product exists, handle the request in the context of the APIs, policies, and access rules configured for the product. 
1. If an open product including the API isn't found, check whether the API requires a subscription. If a subscription isn't required, handle the request in the context of that API and operation.
1. If no configured product or API is found, then access is denied.
