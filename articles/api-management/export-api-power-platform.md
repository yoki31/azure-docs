# Export APIs from Azure API Management to the Power Platform 

Citizen developers using the Microsoft [Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com) often need to reach the business capabilities that are developed by professional developers and deployed in Azure. [Azure API Management](https://aka.ms/apimrocks) enables professional developers to publish their backend service as APIs, and easily export these APIs to the Power Platform ([Power Apps](/powerapps/powerapps-overview) and [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started)) as custom connectors for discovery and consumption by citizen developers. 

This article walks through the steps in the Azure portal to create a custom Power Platform connector to an API in API Management. With this capability, citizen developers can use the Power Platform to create and distribute apps that are based on internal and external APIs managed by API Management.

## Prerequisites

+ Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md)
+ Make sure there is an API in your API Management instance that you'd like to export to the Power Platform
+ Make sure you have a Power Apps or Power Automate [environment](/powerapps/powerapps-overview#power-apps-for-admins) 

## Create a custom connector to an API

1. Navigate to your API Management service in the Azure portal.
1. In the menu, under **APIs**, select **Power Platform**.
1. Select **Create a connector**.
1. In the **Create a connector** window, do the following:
    1. Select an API to publish to the Power Platform.
    1. Select a Power Platform environment to publish the API to. 
    1. Enter a display name, which will be used as the name of the custom connector.  
    1. Optionally, if the API is [protected by an OAuth 2.0 server](api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad.md), provide details including **Client ID**, **Client secret**, **Authorization URL**, **Token URL**, and **Refresh URL**.  
1. Select **Create**.

Once the connector is created, navigate to your [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) or [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) environment. You will see the API listed under **Data > Custom Connectors**.

> [!NOTE]
> To call the API from the Power Apps test console, you need to add the "https://flow.microsoft.com" URL as an origin to the [CORS policy](api-management-cross-domain-policies.md#CORS) in your API Management instance.
