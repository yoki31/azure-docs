# Software releases for OTA updates

The OTA update is built for users who tend to always keep the dev kit up to date. That's why only the hard-stop versions and the latest version are provided here. To change your dev kit to a specific (older) version, use the USB cable update. Refer to [Update the Azure Percept DK over a USB-C cable connection](./how-to-update-via-usb.md). Also use the USB update if you want to jump to a much advanced version.

>[!CAUTION]
>Dev kit doesn't support SW version downgrade with OTA. The Device Update for IoT Hub framework will NOT block deploying an image with version older than the current one. However doing so to dev kit will result in loss of data and functionality.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be sure to check the following document before you decide to go with either OTA or USB cable update.

## Hard-stop version of OTA

Microsoft would service each dev kit release with OTA packages. However, as there are breaking changes for dev kit OS/firmware, or the OTA platform, OTA directly from an old version to a much-advanced version may be problematic. Generally, when a breaking change happens, Microsoft will make sure that the OTA update process transitions the old system seamlessly to **the very first version that introduces/deliver this breaking change**. This specific version becomes a hard-stop version for OTA. Take a known hard-stop version: **June release** as an example. OTA will work if a user updates the dev kit from 2104 to 2106, then from 2106 to 2107. However, it will NOT work if a user tries to skip the hard-stop (2106) and update the dev kit from 2104 directly to 2107.

## Recommendations for applying the OTA update

**Scenario 1:** Frequently (monthly) update the dev kit to make sure itâ€™s always up to date

- There should be no problem if you always do OTA to update the dev kit from last release to the newly released version.

**Scenario 2:** Do update while few versions might be skipped.

1. Identify the current software version of dev kit.
1. Review the OTA package release list to look for any hard-stop version between the current version and target version.
    - If there is, you need to sequentially deploy the hard-stop version(s) until you can deploy the latest update package.
    - If there isn't, then you can directly deploy the latest OTA package to the dev kit.

## Identify the current software version of dev kit

**Option 1:**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Percept Studio](./overview-azure-percept-studio.md).
1. In **Devices**, choose your dev kit device.
1. In the **General** tab, look for the **Model** and **SW Version** information.

**Option 2:**

1. View the **IoT Edge Device** of **IoT Hub** service from Microsoft Azure portal.
1. Choose your dev kit device from the device list.
1. Select **Device twin**.
1. Scroll through the device twin properties and locate **"model"** and **"swVersion"** under **"deviceInformation"** and make a note of their values.

## Identify the OTA package(s) to be deployed
