# Tutorial: Voice control your inventory and visualize with Power BI Dashboard 
This article will give detailed instructions for building the main components of the solution and deploying the edge speech AI. The solution uses Azure Percept DK device and the Audio SoM, Azure Speech Services -Custom Commands, Azure Function App, SQL Database, and Power BI. Users can learn how to manage their inventory with voice using Azure Percept Audio and visualize results with Power BI. The goal of this article is to empower users to create a basic inventory management solution.

Users who want to take their solution further can add an additional edge module for visual inventory inspection or expand on the inventory visualizations within Power BI.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Create an Azure SQL Server and SQL Database
- Create an Azure function project and publish to Azure
- Import an available template to Custom Commands
- Create a Custom Commands using an available template
- Deploy modules to your Devkit
- Import dataset from Azure SQL to Power BI

## Software Architecture 
![Solution Architecture](./media/voice-control-your-inventory-images/voice-control-solution-architect.png)


## Section 1: Create an Azure SQL Server and SQL Database
In this section, you will learn how to create the table for this lab. This table will be the main source of truth for your current inventory and the basis of data visualized in Power BI.

1. Set SQL server firewall
   1. Click Set server firewall 
        ![Set server firewall](./media/voice-control-your-inventory-images/set-server-firewall.png)  
   2. Add Rule name workshop - Start IP 0.0.0.0 and End IP 255.255.255.255 to the IP allowlist for lab purpose
        ![Rule name workshop](./media/voice-control-your-inventory-images/save-workshop.png)  
   3. Click Query editor to login your sql database <br />
        ![Query editor to login your sql database](./media/voice-control-your-inventory-images/query-editor.png) <br /> 
   4. Login to your SQL database through SQL Server Authentication <br />
        ![SQL Server Authentication](./media/voice-control-your-inventory-images/sql-authentication.png) <br />
2. Run the T-SQL query below in the query editor to create the table <br />

       
   ```sql
   -- Create table stock
   CREATE TABLE Stock
   (
            color varchar(255), 
            num_box int 
   )

   ```
    
    ![create the table](./media/voice-control-your-inventory-images/create-sql-table.png) 
 
## Section 2: Create an Azure function project and publish to Azure
In this section, you will use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in Python. Later in this article, you'll publish your function code to Azure.
