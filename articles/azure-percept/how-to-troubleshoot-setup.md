# Troubleshoot the Azure Percept DK setup experience

Refer to the table below for workarounds to common issues found during the [Azure Percept DK setup experience](./quickstart-percept-dk-set-up.md). If your issue still persists, contact Azure customer support.

|Issue|Reason|Workaround|
|:-----|:------|:----------|
|The Azure Percept DK Wi-Fi access point passphrase/password doesn't work| We have heard reports that some welcome cards may have incorrect passphrase/password printed.|In order to retrieve the Wi-Fi SoftAP password of your Percept Devkit, you must connect and use an Ethernet cable. Once the cable is attached and the device powered on, you’ll need to find the IP address that was assigned to your devkit. In “Home” situations you may be able to log in to your home router to get this info. Look for an ASUS device named “apdk-xxxxxxx”. The article [Connect to Azure Percept DK over Ethernet](./how-to-connect-over-ethernet.md) can guide you if you’re not able to get the IP from the router. Once you have the Ethernet’s IP, start a web browser and manually copy and paste this address: IE: http://192.168.0.222 to go to the Onboarding experience. <ul><li>Don’t go through the full setup just yet.</li><li>Setup Wi-Fi and create your SSH User and pause there (you can leave that window open and complete setup after we get the SoftAP password).</li><li>Open Putty or an SSH client and connect to the devkit using the user/pw you just created.</li><li>**Run: sudo tpm2_handle2psk 0x81000009.** The output from this command will be your password for the SoftAP. – Please write it down on the card –</li></ul>
|When connecting to the Azure account sign-up pages or to the Azure portal, you may automatically sign in with a cached account. If you don't sign in with the correct account, it may result in an experience that is inconsistent with the documentation.|The result of a browser setting to "remember" an account you have previously used.|From the Azure page, select on your account name in the upper right corner and select **sign out**. You can then sign in with the correct account.|
|The Azure Percept DK Wi-Fi access point (apd-xxxx) doesn't appear in the list of available Wi-Fi networks.|It's usually a temporary issue that resolves within 15 minutes.|Wait for the network to appear. If it doesn't appear after more than 15 minutes, reboot the device.|
|The connection to the Azure Percept DK Wi-Fi access point frequently disconnects.|It's usually because of a poor connection between the device and the host computer. It can also be caused by interference from other Wi-Fi connections on the host computer.|Make sure that the antennas are properly attached to the dev kit. If the dev kit is far away from the host computer, try moving it closer. Turn off any other internet connections such as LTE/5G if they're running on the host computer.|
|The host computer shows a security warning about the connection to the Azure Percept DK access point.|It's a known issue that will be fixed in a later update.|It's safe to continue through the setup experience.|
|The Azure Percept DK Wi-Fi access point (scz-xxxx or apd-xxxx) appears in the network list but fails to connect.|It could be because of a temporary corruption of the dev kit's Wi-Fi access point.|Reboot the dev kit and try again.|
|Unable to connect to a Wi-Fi network during the setup experience.|The Wi-Fi network must currently have internet connectivity to communicate with Azure. EAP[PEAP/MSCHAP], captive portals, and enterprise EAP-TLS connectivity is currently not supported.|Ensure your Wi-Fi network type is supported and has internet connectivity.|
|**Device Code Errors** <br><br> If you received the following errors on the device code page: <br><br>**In the setup experience UI** - Unable to get device code. Make sure the device is connected to internet; <br><br> **In the browser's Web Developer Mode** - Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Unavailable) <br><br>or <br><br>Certificate not yet valid. | There's an issue with your Wi-Fi network that's blocking the device from completing DNS queries or contacting a NTP time server. | Try plugging in an Ethernet cable to the devkit or connecting to a different Wi-Fi network then try again. <br><br> Less common causes could be that your host computer's date/time are incorrect.  |
|**Issues when using the Device Code**<br><br> After using the Device Code and signing into Azure, you're presented with an Azure error message about policy permissions or compliance issues. You'll be unable to continue the setup experience.<br><br> Here are some of the errors you may see:<br><br>**BlockedByConditionalAccessOnSecurityPolicy** The tenant admin has configured a security policy that blocks this request. Check the security policies defined at the tenant level to determine if your request meets the policy. <br><br>**DevicePolicyError** The user tried to sign into a device from a platform that's currently not supported through Conditional Access policy.<br><br>**DeviceNotCompliant** - Conditional Access policy requires a compliant device, and the device isn't compliant. The user must enroll their device with an approved MDM provider like Intune<br><br>**BlockedByConditionalAccess** Access has been blocked by Conditional Access policies. The access policy doesn't allow token issuance.<br><br>**You cannot access this right now** - Your sign-in was successful but does not meet the criteria to access this resource   |Some Azure tenants may block the usage of “Device Codes” for manipulating Azure resources as a Security precaution. It's usually the result of your organization's Conditional Access IT policies. As a result, the Azure Percept Setup experience can't create any Azure resources for you. <br><br>Your Conditional Access policy requires you to be connected to your corporate network or VPN to proceed.    |Work with your organization to understand their conditional access IT policies.  |
