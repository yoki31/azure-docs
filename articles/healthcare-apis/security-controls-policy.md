# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for FHIR service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance.md)
provides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for the FHIR service in the Azure Healthcare APIs. You can assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources compliant with the specific standard.
